Lecture 01, 28 October 1986: Introduction: Pleats and Folds 
 
I am saying that these aren’t problems for us. I would just ask for us one small thing: to have a vague, or even a confused, idea about what “Baroque” might be called, a very, very simple idea that we can consider as an hypothesis, and then we would look for the consequences of this hypothesis. We would develop the hypothesis, and then we would see if that works. We would need to have a functional hypothesis, I mean, not defining an essence of the Baroque, but defining something that the Baroque would be presumed to create, an operation. I believe we would get out of all these problems that would wear us out from the start, that is, what does the word “Baroque” mean? Does it refer to this or to that? Under what conditions might it be usefully used? If we have an operating hypothesis, what constitutes a Baroque man? And my hypothesis is very simple, but on the condition that this operation coincides neither with an operation that might be called Renaissance, nor one that might be called Classical, nor one that might be called Romantic, etc. On the operating level, we have to look for a certain specificity of the Baroque.
If I am formulating a very general hypothesis, I already have the answer. I am not questioning myself about the location in which the Baroque did this or that, a musical essence, an architectural essence, a literary essence. I am saying a very simple thing: the Baroque creates folds, the Baroque creates folds. It’s a hypothesis. The fold is therefore the essential characteristic of the Baroque understood as an operating action. For me, for those who were here last year, this assures me as being the entirely natural transition from last year. We were speaking frequently about the fold, but from another viewpoint. For this year, we find ourselves faces with the necessity, perhaps, the necessity of confirming, of trying to construct a concept of the fold, which as concept, obviously, if all goes well, must follow all the sinuosity of Leibniz’s philosophy. In fact, if this philosophy is under the sign of the fold, it is normal that I speak of a sinuous philosophy. 
What does all that mean, that the Baroque is what creates folds? I cannot yet know. I am saying the Baroque is located where matter does not cease being pleated, being pleated onto itself, or where the soul does not cease being folded, the pleats of matter and the folds of the soul . If I am saying the soul folds into itself, that matter pleats onto itself, sense at least I don’t know if this is Baroque, but I know that it’s not about anything of interest to a Classic, nor is it about anything of interest to a Romantic. We are going forward by intuition. It’s not that I would already like to tell you something; what I do want to say, directly to your heart, the pleats of matter and the folds of the soul and to tell you, yes indeed, someone who says this or does that, who folds the soul or pleats the body, well yes, that’s someone Baroque. I don’t at all know why yet, or how. It’s not easy to fold one’s soul, meaning that today and perhaps the next time again, we will proceed through a simple introduction, on this subject of “Leibniz as Baroque philosopher.” Notably, we are going forward with a group an aggregate of guideposts around the themes “pleats of matter” and “the folds of the soul”, so that in today’s session, we could place it under the sign of paragraph 61 in the Monadology, where in this paragraph from the Monadology, it ends in a truly splendid way: could never bring out all at once everything that is folded into it because its folds go on to infinity. It’s not even explained, not even explained.
First try to get a sense of this; it’s a very strange statement. Can you imagine there being a similar expression in Descartes, for those who know Descartes? No, it’s unimaginable: the folds of the soul. This expression is beautiful. You have to learn it by heart. Yes, it’s gotten lost. “It could never bring out all at once everything that is folded into it because its folds go on to infinity. But this gives us something. The fold, the Baroque fold goes on to infinity. The fold that goes on to infinity, it’s the pleat since it’s obvious that it’s not the Baroque that invented the fold. For example, in sculpture, there are always folds, if only through the presentation of clothing. A piece of clothing creates folds. Yes, certainly, a garment creates folds; every fold is not Baroque. Fine. So much the better. Our hypothesis is fine since we already have the differential characteristic of the Baroque. Yes, every fold is not Baroque, but not every fold goes on to infinity. When the fold goes on to infinity, then it’s Baroque.
Oh, but what can that even mean, the fold going on to infinity? So, every fold is pleated; that does not limit its usefulness – this is indeed what Leibniz says because, on the fold of the soul, he says: since they go on to infinity, these are pleated. That does not limit their usefulness for us. Above all, we will speak of the pleats of matter and the folds of the soul. Are there two levels, and should the Baroque thus be on two levels, one for the pleats of matter and one for the folds of the soul? This is already very important for us for then another question would be posed: what is the relation between the pleats of matter and the folds of the soul, and vice versa? You indeed sense that between the aggregates of folds, can a relation of causality be established? We can certainly establish bi-univocal correspondences. This will be a system – hey, a system! – a system of correspondences between the pleats of matter and the folds of the soul.
But finally, all that is rather obscure, but this obscurity is so much more relaxed, easy, than if we approached Leibniz’s philosophy abstractly – for it’s not an abstract philosophy like all philosophy – so that the first aspect … I would like to establish a system of guideposts both in what is usually called the Baroque and in Leibniz’s philosophy.
My first system of guideposts concerns the pleats of matter.  I would say that the Baroque is the presentation of a form of matter that does not cease creating folds or being pleated back or being unfolded. Under this first aspect, this means that the Baroque is defined in fact, as a treatment of matter, which means what? Which consists of what? I would say that the treatment of matter is a treatment in bulk . The Baroque treats matter in huge masses, and the notion of mass is fundamental within the Baroque. One of the best commentators and one of the first commentators on the Baroque is Wölfflin, in a book that is without doubt, and remains, the best book or one of the best books on the Baroque, Renaissance and Baroque . Wölfflin emphasizes this first point, the treatment of matter in bulk as a characteristic of the Baroque. And as Wölfflin tells us, this is how the Baroque operates within the colossal or the huge, and he says that its characteristic is gravitas, gravity, weight. And we recognize Baroque architecture not in a single characteristic, but among characteristics, within the following characteristic: the increase of architectural dimensions, but in what form? We are going to locate… Let’s try to establish some guideposts. 
According to Wölfflin, the first characteristic is horizontal enlargement, a kind of enlargement that is located, for example, in the horizontal enlargement of facades in Baroque architecture. And this enlargement is confirmed by the lowering of the pediment – I am saying some very, very elementary things regarding architecture – the lowering of the pediment, or also the lower arch, henceforth elliptical, like a kind of gravitas, the fullness of the wall that no longer allows the sight of articulations that operate there as a kind of … that is covered over, with its articulations covered over, implying an enlargement effect, the pillar instead of the column, the same effect, staircases with lowered steps. For example, in Michelangelo, you already find not only lower steps on staircases, but as regards Michelangelo’s famous staircases, , I see it like this. Perhaps you sense the birth of the fold, and this confinement , so this puffiness , with its lowered steps, this swelling, this puffiness produces a thrusting movement . Fine. Baroque staircases are the most delightful to climb, you know, the wide and low step. You hardly have the impression of climbing.
Fine. The second characteristic connecting to this is a kind of treatment of matter not simply by enlargement, but – suddenly you sense that this is connected; I have no desire to undertake logical deduction; you sense that these are very natural passages – so henceforth the treatment of matter through softening . The masses are soft, the treatment of mass not only in bulk, but in soft masses. In other words, the softness of the form in Michelangelo’s staircases is obvious. At the extreme, we would have to speak of a tendency of matter toward the fluid, a kind of turbulence of matter.
And what does this position of soft masses imply? It implies something that is essential, that will be essential for us today and for the next time: a rounding off of angled forms. As Wölfflin says, repeating it at several points so that it seems to be something fundamental concerning the Baroque, the right angle is avoided. For example, the acanthus is a famous leaf. The acanthus leaf is a famous leaf in architecture since it served as decorative motif since the Greeks. But there are two kinds of acanthus, at least, right? There is the acanthus, in Latin, acanthus mollis, with rounded leaves, and the acanthus spinosus, meaning pointed, edged. There is the rounded leaf, mollis, and the serrated leaf. The Baroque was not the first to employ this. The Baroque undertakes on its own the substitution of the soft acanthus, mollis, for the serrated acanthus leaf that dominated before the Baroque.
What does this mean, this tendency toward softness, toward the fluid, once again, represented by the rounding off of the angle, the avoidance of the right angle? At the extreme, this is like a conciliation of mass and water. There would be a lot to discuss about this softness of forms. For example, there’s Michelangelo who invented a curious procedure, creating architectural models not as sculptures, his architectural models in clay. And once again, those who will read Wölfflin’s book, which is altogether beautiful, would find the extent to which he insists on this tendency in the Baroque of avoiding the right angle, of rounding off the form, that allows precisely for a clay-like model.
And at the extreme, I say that it’s a conciliation of mass and water. In fact, the Baroque is not only a kind of architecture, it’s an art of gardens, and the art of gardens entails a treatment of water. And Wölfflin himself, at the end of his book, insists on the art of Baroque gardens, with the three forms of treatment of water: the fountain, the waterfall, and the water feature, a lake or a pond. He shows that in all cases, the originality of the Baroque, of the Baroque garden, is that the water itself must act massively , and in opposition to what? In opposition to clear streams, clear streams that, in contrast, dominate in all kinds of water structures. But the Baroque structure operates through massive forms of water, even in the fountain: the multiple water jets connect, constituting a mass. In the end, fluid is massive just as mass is fluid. And at this level, we see that, henceforth, everything operates in bulk, the solid that is, in fact, a soft solid, the fluid that is, in fact, a massive fluid with turbulence, and yet in consonance with other masses.
Do you sense the birth of another theme? It’s that among the masses, there can only be harmony, harmony of masses, harmony as resonance of masses. Among the masses, there must be harmonies. And what does that mean? Well, it means that the masses of leaves and the masses of waters respond to one another, entering into counterpoint. And why into counterpoint? They are both audible . There are audible masses in correspondence with visual masses. The audible masses are called uproar , and the uproar of leaves must respond to the uproar of waters.  
And Wölfflin insists greatly on this, how precisely in Baroque art, the leaves are treated as mass, from which results the rounding off of leaves, and not treated leaf by leaf, as an art of mass, an art of mass that is the Baroque. Understand, simply, if this is an art of mass, understand that it’s an art of the soft, an art of the soft. Why is the mass soft? If that’s what creates mass, it’s a way of saying that mass cannot be engendered starting from individuals, from ultimate individuals. There are no ultimate individuals. This treatment is necessarily the mass treatment operating through softening, that is, through rounding off of angled forms. How to say what we are sensing here, that the angled form is the hard, that the rounding off of angled forms is the soft?
Good. So let’s try to identify… We just created a few guideposts on the level of the Baroque, you see? We move forward just a bit. What does it mean to create folds? I can say – let’s have a break here -- you see, creating folds is what? Well, it’s rounding off angles, creating folds. We are not very far into this, but that’s it: to round off angles, but you sense that we have to change this expression for many things. Rounding off angles, hmm, this is whatever you want, but among other things, it’s possible that this is a mathematical operation. It’s possible that this could have lots of outcomes. How… Can you round off angles in math? Perhaps you can. Perhaps Leibniz never stopped rounding off angles. He was a great mathematician, so he was capable of doing that. So, we just say, here we are, the Baroque, you see, how does it create folds? By undertaking a treatment in bulk, and this treatment in bulk undertakes this by rounding off angles, by constituting soft matter.
We have to see if Leibniz’s philosophy, even before you are familiar with it – I am looking for guideposts – if Leibniz’s philosophy is consonant with all that. Oh yes! Matter is treated so much in bulk by Leibniz that it is never separable from a term that Leibniz uses, the aggregate . Matter proceeds through the aggregate, and the aggregate is the law of matter. The soul will have no less of a law as well, and the whole problem in Leibniz’s philosophy will be what the correspondence between these two laws is. I am saying immediately that the soul’s law is not the aggregate. It’s the series, but you sense perhaps that the series is also something very Baroque. Why? For the moment, that’s beyond us. Matter is divided into aggregates, and the aggregates are themselves divided into aggregates. An entire uproar of matter… On the level of matter, you will only find aggregates infinitely divisible and infinitely composable. So, I am just saying that aggregates ignore angles. Aggregates are curves. As they go all the way to infinity, a curve that goes to infinity is a fold. Aggregates create folds.
Let’s look at the guideposts a bit better with Leibniz. In all of his physics – and Leibniz is also a great physicist – in all of his physics, what does Leibniz create? a physics of bodies that he himself calls elastic. For Leibniz, elasticity – and he tells us this in print – is the degree of fluidity of a body; a physics of the elastic body or of the fluid body, elasticity meaning a degree of fluidity of the body. He is opposed to Descartes and to Descartes’s physics, no less than to the physics of Atomists, whether it’s the Atomists from antiquity or the Atomists from the seventeenth century who conceive of physics above all as being about the hard body. For Leibniz, there is no hard body, and he will never stop criticizing Descartes because the entire Cartesian physics is a physics of the hard body to the extent that certain Cartesians drew the correct consequence from Cartesian physics, to wit, they returned to Atomism, the atom being the smallest hard body. But for Leibniz, there is no atom. Every mass is composed of mass, all the way to infinity, no more than there is a hard body, every body being elastic, its elasticity being equal to its degree of fluidity. a physics of the fluid or of the body’s elastic force – in Latin, vis elastica, Leibniz says. 
And why? I would just like it a bit if you knew more, or perhaps some among you already know all this, but an essential point in Leibniz’s physics is what? Everyone knows; we learn that in high school. It’s having substituted the principle of conservation mv2 for mv. Descartes had stated mv; Leibniz says mv2: it’s his famous raising speed to the square. And we ask what this raising speed to the square might mean? It means a lot of things as we will see, but here I am satisfied with simple guideposts. V2 refers us to acceleration, and in fact, Leibniz will center his entire study, or will center a large part of his study on acceleration. And what is acceleration? It’s a difference; it’s a difference between the movement at a particular moment and the movement in the preceding state, in the preceding moment; or it’s between the movement at particular moment and the movement in the subsequent state. It’s a difference, or as Leibniz will say more precisely in mathematics, it’s a differential, a difference that can be, if you like, as small as you wish. To this differential, Leibniz gives a name: it’s the conatus of movement. All this that I am saying is quite summary. We will see it later; we will see it much more precisely. 
As there is a possibility of infinite analysis between two moments, there is an infinite sum of conatus which is like degrees through which the body passes when the speed of its movement increases or when the speed of its movement slows, or when it passes from a state of rest into movement. We will say that movement is like an integral or an integration of elementary solicitations that Leibniz calls tendencies, that is, some conatus, such that Leibniz pretends to assign a genetic element of movement. The genetic element of movement is the element of a series of increasing or decreasing speeds, the element of a series of increasing or decreasing speeds, whereas Cartesian physics limited itself to the following model: the actual element of a given speed, in consideration of an actual element of a given speed, such as it appears in Descartes, is substituted by Leibniz, the element of a series of increasing or decreasing speeds, a summons of conatus. That is, there is an infinity of degrees through which the mobile passes; there is an infinity of degrees through which the mobile passes when its speed increases or decreases. What is that? You understand? I just wanted to say this: this is the translation of the elasticity of the body in terms of movement. This regime of movement is the elasticity of the body. 
Perhaps you are not far from understanding how, in a physics of the elastic body, no rectilinear movement is possible. One must always round off, and round off to infinity. Movement will occur following curves, with variable curvature. But in this, finally, we are getting too far ahead, going too fast, but I have said some things, in fact, just as part of the guidepost of our topic. So, if you don’t understand this or that point or theme, it’s enough for you to understand one or two since you can already sense that everything is harmonized at one level or another: the status of movement, the status of the elastic body. All of that corresponds; it’s a system of correspondences, and perhaps that’s what the word “system” means. 
And why… I would just link to insist: henceforth, why… We indeed see that the elastic body is a critique of the atom which is the very image of the hard body. But I say “elastic body,” you can only think of it on a curve, with variable curvature. What does that mean? I am just saying… We indeed see how all of this connects; in fact, it connects quite well. You take an atom as hard body, hard body, indivisible … 
Movement is nothing other than the correlation – this is how it is for Epicurus – nothing other than the correlation of the atom and the void. If there is movement, it’s because there are no atoms; as Lucretius said very well, there are atoms and there is the void; the correlation of the atom and the void is the movement as rectilinear movement. The atom falls into the void. Straight lines, completely straight… Good… But there are atoms that fall into the void. All of that is annoying because they don’t meet. The solution from Epicurus, to explain the encounter, is famous, notably: incerto tempore… Here I speak Latin on purpose because I can’t do otherwise since I don’t know what that means. “At one moment,” tempore, incerto, what is this? Fine. Incerto tempore produces a small deviation, a tiny deviation to which Lucretius gives a famous name, the clinamen,  a declination, that is, it leaves the straight line. Thanks to the clinamen, we understand that the atom encounters the atom and that atomic combinations occur, combinations of hard bodies. So I would say that the combinations here move off obliquely. It’s still a straight line. The compositions of hard bodies that are created are rectilinear.
All of that, I would like to have you feel… All of that, it’s quite superficial , but each time, I am trying to create a kind of… to indicate the logical complementarities. If you provide yourself with a hard element, I believe that through evidence, well … If you provide yourself with a presumably absolutely hard element, you can only compose mixtures or combinations along a straight line. That is, you would have to engender curves through combinations of straight lines, which is quite possible, but this is a very special kind of mathematics.
So, here we are. The atom taking incerto tempore, does it do so at a given moment? Since Antiquity, people have made fun of the Epicureans, saying oh yeh, so that’s easy to say! At one moment, there is the atom leaving the vertical and taking a deviation with a small angle in relation to the vertical. This small angle, the angle of deviation, the angle of the clinamen -- that gave Cicero quite a laugh -- it’s not reasonable, it’s childish, all that. But incerto, it’s not clear that this means “at any given moment whatsoever”, not necessarily. And in fact, you know… Let’s assume the atom to be the smallest body. This isn’t entirely true since for the Epicureans, or for Lucretius, the atom has numerous parts. It does not constitute the minimum, but that doesn’t keep it from being indivisible . I mean that, to some extent, it doesn’t have indivisible parts. It’s the smallest indivisible body.
Fine. For Lucretius and for the Epicureans, the idea of the smallest body is obviously an eminent body, which is the smallest time, that is, the atom of time. What is this, the atom of time? It’s the smallest time thinkable, or rather I think a time, during which the atom is in movement in a given direction. The smallest time… There you are. You think of the falling atom. Have you got it, in your mind? You think of the falling atom, of its duration, of its drop. Fine. You do the opposite experiment. It’s a thought experiment. You try to think the smallest time that you can, think as the time in which the atom falls. So there is an atom of time, the smallest during which the atom is thought of as falling, fine, falling in a straight line. Well then, you understand everything!
Incerto means what? Incerto means… Incerto tempore means in a time smaller than the minimum of thinkable time. If there is a minimum of thinkable time in which one must think of the atom’s fall, I can think of rest. In order to think of the atom’s movement, I have to think of it in time, falling in time, its descent occupying a certain time, and there, a minimum beyond which the atom will be necessarily thought of as being up . If I say, let’s consider a time smaller than the minimum of thinkable time, you will tell me, I can’t think that. Fine, I can’t think that. I pose it; I don’t think it. I pose a time smaller than the minimum thinkable time. I am saying the clinamen, the deviation, which occurs in this time. The deviation does not come on the vertical at any moment whatsoever; it is already presupposed through the entire rectilinear line. It affects the entire vertical. It launched an oblique, creating an oblique since incerto tempore means not in some arbitrary time whatsoever, but in a time smaller than the minimum thinkable time. So, there is a straight line, but it is always already oblique, such that the atom necessarily encounters the atom. 
This comes down to saying that a physics of hard bodies is what? It implies a rectilinear construction of components, and it implies oblique straight lines that are defined by the angle – these are angular formations – that are defined by the angle in relation to the vertical. In other words, the formations of hard bodies are rectilinear and angular.
Fine. Understand, this works fine for us, Leibniz’s physics, a physics of elastic bodies, and henceforth, of curvatures, and henceforth, of curvatures. We still don’t yet understand what that means, but elasticity rounds off the angles. Curvature is the rounding off of angles. The Leibnizian aggregates are masses infinitely composed of masses. Henceforth, they are curves. We can’t get away from it: you repeat that to yourself enough for you to understand it. I can do no better, because if you don’t understand, it’s because you haven’t yet repeated it enough in your mind. Soft masses are necessarily curves; elastic masses are necessarily curves. The mobile, here, is on an infinitely variable curve. What is the fold that goes all the way to infinity? It’s the curvature with a variable surface. It’s the line with variable curvature or the surface with variable curvature. This is what all of Descartes’s physics and mathematics could not detect: a physics of elastic bodies was required. And what does that imply? special mathematical tools. We will see how these mathematical tools… As if by chance, these are infinite series and differential calculus. Fine. 
How are you doing? Still holding up? So a little later we are going… Today, this is a short session. final point on this treatment in bulk. Let’s consider… You see, we are establishing guideposts. First, the body in general , good, with its enlargement and its lowering. And then, the second guidepost, the elastic or even fluid body. And all that is a way of saying: what does it mean to create folds? Matter creates folds; it doesn’t follow the angles. Understand? Good. That’s what Leibniz’s philosophy is. 
Let’s confirm a third and final guidepost, the living body, the folds of flesh. It’s a constant theme. There is a poem; there’s a Baroque poet, a very great Baroque poet, John Donne. There is a beautiful poem by him; I don’t dare recite it to you in English, because… He speaks about a pair of lovers, and he says, You are both fluid,” “You are both fluid.” But this is the Baroque conception of mass. Mass is fundamentally fluid, and you no longer have any angles. And in the same poem, he will add, “Your face flows…” The love poem is perpetually penetrated by metaphors of fluid. This is how one creates a Baroque poem, a great Baroque poem.
Good, but I am saying the living body… that in fact, it’s the least of things to say that the living body, or flesh, creates folds – folds and pleats of flesh. Fine, but why does it create folds? For two reasons, for two reasons, I believe, and here, we have to return to all sorts of ancient biological doctrines in which Leibniz participated. You have to place yourself with the initial astonishment at the discovery of the microscope, and you have to resituate all this philosophy of life under two expressions, which are not literally in Leibniz’s works, but the spirit is there. The first expression is: “All flies are within the first fly”; all flies are within the first fly. I cannot say that this is signed by Leibniz, or that Leibniz said it or repeated it, but it’s a commonplace of the philosophy of life at the end of the seventeenth century, one that comes to be confirmed by the discovery of the microscope. What does this mean, “all flies are within the first fly”? It means that the first fly that God created contained all the others, that is, contained the infinity of flies to come. It’s a lyrical expression to qualify what is called the pre-formation of germs, or the point of view of pre-formation. The primitive egg contained all the eggs to come, but that would mean nothing if we only said the primitive egg contains the organism. In other words, the primitive egg envelops the organism, and envelops as well all the organisms to come of the same species. It’s the thesis of pre-formation. 
It envelops: what does that mean? It means that there is something in mathematics called a kind of homothety, a homothety from small to large, or rather from large to small, however small it might be. The organism envelops organisms to infinity. The first fly contains all the flies to come? Yes, but in a miniscule state, and each fly, in turn, contains an infinity of flies, smaller and smaller flies. If you will, this is the simple reason, the vulgarized vision of the theory of preformation of germs, at the level of the living. The organism contains an infinity of organisms, simply smaller and smaller, and what does that mean? that the whole concept of life is going to be encompassed starting from movements – here, I come again to operations – starting from the operations of envelopment and development.
Envelopment: I am saying this because to envelop is to create folds; to develop is to unfold, and in Latin, the language spoken so often in that era, this is constant, the pairs implicare-explicare, to implicate-to explicate ; involvere-devolvere, to envelop-to develop ; involvere-evolv Evolvere… The three couples: involver-evolver, are strictly synonymous. Impliquer-expliquer: that which is developed, is explained; that which is enveloped, is implicated, or evolves. Based on this, when you find in a text from this era the word “evolution,” certainly don’t believe – I don’t even need to tell you this; it would be a kind of limitless stupidity – that you have discovered an ancestor of evolutionism. For in all these texts, the word “evolution” is used strictly in an opposite sense from what evolutionism will give it, since in evolutionism… What is the innovation in evolutionism at the end of the nineteenth century? It’s to tell us evolution occurs through the production of some new thing, that is, through epigenesis. Evolution occurs through the production of a new thing. That’s the evolutionist idea: starting from the egg, the egg undergoes operations that will produce something new, that is, something that is not encompassed in the egg.
But previously, before evolutionism, in what was called the preformation stage, the word “evolution” does indeed exist. The living being evolves. But what does that mean, “evolve”? It means, if you prefer, to increase , just as involver means “to diminish”, or if you prefer once again, evolver means to unfold , exactly as the butterfly unfolds. It unfolds, or rather it refolds into the cocoon, but the living being passes through alternation of folding and unfolding. To evolve is to unfold one’s parts. The organism unfolds when it unfolds its own parts, and folds itself when it pleats its own parts. Pleating its own parts, it becomes smaller and smaller. Unfolding its own parts, placing them outside one another, it becomes larger and larger. Evolution is a matter of increase, with conservation of similarity, hence the homothety, you see? And involution is the reverse symmetry of  evolution; it’s the diminution with conservation of similarity, such that – here I am saying that this is frequent, for example, in Malebranche and in Leibniz, all that – such that… But Leibniz is going to derive from this some very astonishing consequences. I am telling you immediately so that you will sense the extent to which, in the living body, the notion of the folds finds its importance.
So there are rhythms of folds and unfolds that traverse the living being. That is what creates the flesh, the flesh that’s irreducible to infinity, on the contrary, expressible, unfolding its own parts. The organism folds and pleats its own parts, unfolds and again pleats its own parts. It’s very beautiful vision of the living being, since from this, Leibniz derives the idea that – and it is here that he becomes original – he derives a source for vitalism. What is his vitalism? His vitalism consists in saying: the living being is a machine. You will tell me that “the living being is a machine” is not a vitalist proposition; it’s a mechanicist proposition, that is, precisely the opposite. Well then, precisely not! For, as Leibniz says, and here he becomes quite brilliant – he is so all the time, always brilliant, but here particularly – he says: Do you know what the mechanistic lacks? What is missing in the mechanistic and the mechanicism is that they understand nothing about the machine. In fact, what is opposed to the mechanistic is the machinic. It’s a great, great idea. Why? Because something mechanical is indeed a machine, he says; only it’s a machine that refers to final parts that, in themselves, are not a machine.  For example, it refers to a piece of steel that has taken a particular form, but this piece of steel is not in itself a machine. In other words, something mechanical is a finite machine; it’s a machine whose ultimate parts are not machines, whereas a machine, what is it? It’s a machine that goes on to infinity. It’s a machine in which all the parts to infinity are still machines. It’s a machine machined to infinity. In other words, vitalism equals machinism, the only way to show that the living being is not something mechanical; that is, the living being is a machine.
Paragraph 64 of the Monadology, this is really a beautiful text: Every organized body of a living thing is a kind of divine machine or natural automaton. So we say, alright, this is a mechanicist proposition. But wait for what comes next: Because a man-made machine isn’t a machine in every one of its parts; because a man-made machine isn’t a machine in every one of its parts. This is a mechanism, something mechanical; it’s not a machine. For example, a cog on a brass wheel has parts or fragments which to us are no longer anything artificial, and bear no signs of their relation to the intended use of the wheel. But Nature’s machines”, that is, natural machines or living beings “– living bodies, that is – are machines even in their smallest parts, right down to infinity, an infinitely machined machine. Henceforth, they never cease being folded, so there is a homothety of the parts and the whole. And what is the whole if not the unfolded part? And what is the part if not the whole that is enveloped and pleated?
 to the point that Leibniz can ask – and you know, it’s not complicated, the story that has frightened pious souls – what happens with death? But with death, it’s very simple. I am going to tell you what happens with death. In fact, there is no soul without the body, so the idea that at death, our soul is separated from the body is an entirely stupid question just to simplify things. That’s not it; in fact, there is no soul without the body. Simply, at death, our body is enveloped to infinity, such that it becomes livable infinity. And although one might then have oneself cremated, incinerated, that changes nothing, for in the ashes, there will still be a body, however small it might be, something that is my body in the way it is enveloped to infinity. And God’s judgment? I still maintain a body at death; I maintain a body. Simply this body is infinitely enveloped, infinitely pleated onto itself. It’s such a beautiful idea, and what about God’s judgment? On the day of final judgment, there you have all the infinitely pleated bodies since death coming forth, exactly like a butterfly unfolds, leaving its cocoon; the butterfly unfolds. Well when the judgment of God sounds forth, our bodies will again unfold, and we will, in fact, discover the bodies that will have never left us, that simply had become like so many infinitely folded pinpoints. This is beautiful. This is the infinitely machined machine that you can grasp on these two levels: either infinite contractions – the body infinitely folded onto itself – or infinite extension – the body unfolded on itself, the glorious body of the final judgment.
So, why one must still criticize mechanicism is for having understood nothing about machines, and vitalism is the identity of the living being with an infinitely machined machine. So that is the first aspect that, if you will, concerns the organism. There is an infinity of organisms in the organism, that is, an infinity of organisms are folds into each organism. There are flies from flies from flies to infinity. And here we have the other aspect of vitalism – there’s another aspect -- which is that, henceforth… But organisms themselves, where do they come from? They no doubt come from simple living beings since they are aggregates of organisms. They come from simple living beings, but I don’t yet know what that means. We will see later about “the Simple” in Leibniz, as this might exist, since everything goes on to infinity. Were there no simple beings… I say randomly, in any event, the simple living beings would exist on another level than the one where we are.
So if that is the case, what will the second aspect of vitalism be ? It’s that an organism is always created from a portion of matter insofar as it is animated by simple elements. You see? The first aspect of vitalism is an organicism; the second aspect what is the organism made of? simple elements insofar as they animate a portion of matter, however small it might be. This time, it’s no longer the viewpoint of the egg; it’s the viewpoint of the animalcule, and this is well known in all histories of life, of the notion of life. You will find arguments between schools in the seventeenth century, between a school called Ovism, the egg, the Ovists, and the other calling itself the Animalculists, partisans of animalcules. What counts most, the egg or, in the end, the spermatozoid? It’s a problem that will continue everywhere subsequently. These are the two points of view of vitalism. 
Leibniz brings both of them together quite well. What is an organism made of, that is, the organic material? What is it made of? Well, on the second level, it is said, organic material is made of simple elements animating a portion, however restrained it might be, of inorganic matter. You understand? We have passed from the egg to animalcules. And, this is the path of the microscope. Leibniz’s texts on the microscope are fundamental texts for all philosophy. And so, from this comes a new series of entirely brilliant formulae from Leibniz consisting in telling us about this second viewpoint on animalcules, you see, the simple elements that animate a portion of inorganic matter, however small it might be. What does that come down to saying? That comes down to saying that everything is not alive. Of course, everything isn’t alive! There is inorganic matter, material masses, that are not living. Everything is not alive, but everywhere there are living beings, and I know very few philosophies of life that are as beautiful, even among modern philosophies, as this idea of the diffusion of living beings in Leibniz. You see, this is something else.
The first aspect of vitalism was increases and decreases, that is, envelopments and developments. The second aspect of vitalism is diffusion, the diffusion of animalcules in all portions, whatever they might be, of inorganic matter. And this is as if he was telling us – there are all sorts of Leibniz’s texts suggesting this – it’s as if he was telling us, you understand, in a pond, or in a lake – the treatment of waters in the Baroque – in a lake or a pond, everything is not a fish, but there are fish everywhere . Everything is not a fish in the world, but there are fish everywhere. It’s the second aspect of vitalism. This time, it returns to the expression about simple elements diffused in every portion of inorganic matter, however small it might be.
And in the correspondence with Arnauld, Leibniz is going to follow a comparison – here again the rapports of harmony, consonances, between two cases of matter, the lake full of fish, on one hand, and on the other, the chaos of marble. His texts are sublimes, very, very beautiful. The chaos of marble appears to be the hardest body. And Leibniz is going to show that the chaos of marble does not differ in nature from the pond full of fish; and in the chaos of marble as well, there is an infinity of diffused animalcules. 
So, good… Fine. Everything is not a fish, but there are fish everywhere. The world is a pond full of fish. I would say that this vitalism matters to us because it confirms … What does it confirm? The treatment in bulk. I am summing up our results: the treatment in bulk as a possible definition of the Baroque operates on all levels by folding and unfolding. Second concluding proposition: the folds and unfolds go all the way to infinity. This is the difference of the Baroque from all other formations. Third conclusion: if this is so, then bodies are not hard bodies, but elastic bodies and, at the extreme, fluid bodies, and their paths are not rectilinear, but curved, and their operation consists in perpetually rounding off angles, avoiding the angle, necessarily through a curvature, through a variable curvature.
There we are, the first aspect that concerned us: is there a treatment of matter that might be called Baroque? You are going to take a break, but not for very long. And then you can reflect a bit, and you can tell me if there are any difficulties or questions. 
So I’d like you to understand well that this is an introduction that has not at all opened up the philosophy of Leibniz. We are creating guideposts, some very general guideposts. All that we have done during this first part was the treatment of matter according to Leibniz, and asked: is this a treatment that could be called Baroque, and in what sense? No problems? No questions? Good, so let’s continue.
We were dealing earlier with the level of matter, defined as the level of aggregates, if you will, the lowest level. Now, we are going to deal with a higher level, and in fact, we are following Wölfflin’s path who speaks about what exists above this first level of lowered and softened matter. And this second level that we are considering is now obviously that of form, or formal cause, or if you prefer, the genetic element of form. And just as earlier there was a status of matter, now we must expect there to be a certain status of the soul. Just as matter never ceased folding and unfolding, well, there are folds and pleats in the soul. As we saw in the Monadology, paragraph 61: there are folds and pleats in the soul. Everything suggests to us that perhaps, for Leibniz, these folds and pleats in the soul are like ideal elements of form. But here we will require lots of guideposts and explanations in order to understand what that might mean, ideal elements of form, genetic elements of forms. The souls would contain the genetic elements of forms, but it would contain the genetic elements of forms insofar as it creates folds and pleats, or at least insofar as there are folds and pleats within it. You sense that here as well, Leibniz is returning to find that Descartes’s conception of the souls is rather like a ridiculous summary. 
Good, so what are these, the ideal elements? Folds would be ideal and genetic elements that would account for forms. And in other words, the genetic element of the fold is what? I am saying that the genetic element of the fold, is the point that describes the curve, the point on a curve, the point on a curve with variable curvature. . I am offering a kind of drawing of this in a very general form. There. You recognize the curve with variable curvature. The simplest case is the curve with invariable curvature, I would say. We can stop there because you have understood everything; I mean that all of our work this year solely concerns – over a long stretch of time – commenting on this figure. 
What is this figure, the curve with variable curvature, or the curve with constant curvature? I would say that is an inflection, it’s an inflection. What is an inflection? An inflection – I am generally using language from mathematics – the inflection of a line is a singularity, that is – oh, it’s not complicated – a singularity is something that happens to a line; it’s an event, something that happens to a line, the curvature. We will call it point of inflection; it’s a singular point. Every singular point is not an inflection, but the point of inflection is a singular point, the singular point of this inflection. In general, singularities are not independent from an axis of coordinates, but the inflection is independent of any axis of coordinates. It does not assume any coordinates.
That’s what I want to ask: Can we say that there is a genetic irreducibility of the inflection? That is, we have to grasp the inflection as the production of an ideal genesis, as genetic element, that is, as the genetic element that endangers forms. There you are. It seems to me… I cannot say that… It seems to me that this is how it is in Leibniz. The element that engenders forms, the genetic element of forms, is not the rectilinear straight line. It’s the curve with constant variation, the curve with variable curvature, or inflection. irreducibility of the inflection; you still sense this first session’s obsessive theme, always rounding off angles. 
So, if it’s that, I would then say, from the point of view of form… From the point of view of matter, the Baroque, we proposed the following idea: the Baroque is what treats matter in bulk, that is, through folds and pleats going on to infinity. Now, I would say that the Baroque is what treats form through the genetic element of inflection. For the moment, I cannot say more on this, except that we already have to reflect. We have to stop each time, you know, and then look for help, reach out for help. When one speaks or when one writes, there are several things. When one speaks, you need to seek help, you , but up to now, silence alone has answered me back. I can say, help me! Yes! Inflection would be conditional. This would be the genetic element of forms.
Good. We just saw that this is very special, inflection, but what does that mean? I am calling on you for help! And suddenly, by calling on you for help, something crossed through my memory, drawings, some drawings of a famous painter. That’s what flashed in my memory, yes, it’s in Paul Klee. Ah, I tell myself, yes, but Paul Klee, I am going to get criticized: the Baroque, all of this, it’s just random! So obviously, not at all! It’s not me; it’s Paul Klee. Paul Klee was enormously interested in the Baroque. He wrote on the Baroque. So, if he wrote on the Baroque and found merit in the Baroque, perhaps his own drawings… And in a small, marvelous book by Paul Klee, Theory of Modern Art, there is a study of forms in movement. But the forms in movement presuppose an engendering of forms starting from a movement. And what does he tell us, that is, a genesis of forms? So Klee speaks to us under the title “Pedagogical Outlines,” and his pedagogical outlines begin with the affirmation that “the point needs nothing other than its own spontaneity.” This you must retain since we will find it again in Leibniz; you will see in what sense this is mathematically, physically… all of that. It’s a key idea – hey, funny! – It’s a fundamental idea for Leibniz. The point needs only its spontaneity. The point’s spontaneity, what could that mean? Well, the point’s spontaneity is inflection. The point only needs its own spontaneity to follow a curve of inflection.
If I insist on this regarding Klee, it’s because you will see that there is an anti-Klee who is no less a great painter, notably Kandinsky, and that everything… And that this marks their painting, these theoretical stories from the exterior. This is inscribed in their painting. For Kandinsky, on the contrary, the point can enter into movement only under external constraint, such that all of Kandinsky’s painting will be conceived as dealing with tension, the tension exerted on the point to go into movement. And the whole conception of painting for Klee – if there ever was a painter that one could call spontaneous, on the condition of noting that spontaneous obviously does not being creating just anything – the point follows the curve of inflection through its own spontaneity.
The point is therefore the genetic element by itself of what Klee calls, the “active line,” and the active line is this: the drawing on top, that is, an inflection. Eh? Don’t look at anything but the top one ! What’s better than this?! The second figure… Henceforth we will follow… You understand, this is what a relay system is. So I was getting bogged down with my story of inflection. Can it be the genetic element of form? Wouldn’t that be how things are in Leibniz? Since you cannot have me speak directly to Leibniz, since we don’t yet have those means… Everything that is outside Leibniz, so, I didn’t quite know how to proceed. And on this, it’s Klee that gives us the answer. Perfect! Very good! We have only to follow him.
The second figure … It’s a bit far away. I could make a drawing on the board, but I’ve had enough of that. You see, the second figure, the one underneath the first, is all interconnected with another much more capricious line. Fine… It’s when folds… the fold of inflection gets cut across by a line that seems to be a random line, an uncertain line. But it is precisely possible that the line of inflection offers us a kind of law of the uncertain line. 
The third figure – he doesn’t comment on this very well… No, he does comment well on this, so I withdraw what I said – the third, you see, is very interesting because what has he done? What has Paul Klee done? He doesn’t say it, but it is nonetheless interesting. What he has done is to mark the shadows along the side of the inflection’s concavity. Henceforth, the cross-hatching changes around the inflection point. Eh? So what does that create that is innovative? It’s that each time, along the concavity, necessarily on the side of the concavity, a center of curvature is defined, a center of curvature, that is going to vary according to the portion of inflection considered from one side to the other of the inflection point. And again here, I note the case of inflection with constant curvature. If I consider the case of inflection with constant curvature, the center of curvature will vary such that the center of curvature will be on one side as on the other an inflection point, what we can call an enveloper , a region corresponding to the curvature, according to the convergent straight lines. I sense that this is getting complicated, but finally… Notice the center of curvature is going to change directions -- it’s quite simple – and necessarily will not be a point, but will be defined by an enveloper. Fine.
We will leave it there for the moment, for Klee’s drawings, and I complicate things by saying how about Kandinsky? Kandinsky is entirely different. Why? Since for him, the point is normally at rest, there is no spontaneity of the point. Henceforth, the point only moves when a force is exerted on it, pulling it from rest. Henceforth, the line that the point travels along under an external effort will obviously be a straight line. This will be a straight line, and thus, in Kandinsky’s text, Point and Line to Plane, he passes from the point to the straight line under the influence of a force or tension, and tells us: There are three kinds of straight lines, other straight lines only being variants. The simplest straight line is the horizontal line. Opposite this line we fine at a right angle the vertical line. The third line is the diagonal, schematically seen in at an angle identical to the two other preceding lines, thus having the same inclination of both, that is, as a bisector. 
Fine. What am I going to say? If I now say that this would be clear, if I say that Kandinsky, this is a painting of the hard body, and what is so brilliant in Kandinsky? What was Kandinsky able to trace as no other person could trace, by introducing tension here? Anyone who has seen three paintings by Kandinsky would answer that it’s the angles, it’s the angles. This is a painting of the hard body in which movement is angled and in which bodies are composed through rectilinear lines. It’s the most angles in composition ever accomplished in painting.
If we try schematically to describe Klee, we would say it’s a painting of the elastic body. Here, these elastic bodies in Klee, you would find some so admirable. It’s a painting of the elastic body in which the point travels spontaneously; it’s a painting of spontaneity, only it’s not Klee’s own spontaneity, but the spontaneity of the point on the canvas, where the point’s spontaneity is defined through the inflection that the point pursues. Henceforth, it’s a painting that does not cease taking the edges off angles, rounding off the angle, inflecting the angle. 
Someone who worked here , in fact, at some point several years ago, named Bernard Cache, and who is interested in the Baroque, recently published a study, or is currently preparing a very interesting study – because he has a background as an architect – a very interesting study precisely on the problem of inflections in architecture. And his departure point is a bit like Klee’s, so we come back to it: the variations of the inflection. So forget Klee now. We used him to confirm this kind of suspicion we had: can the inflection be treated as the genetic element of forms, and under what conditions, specifically the inflection considered as the point’s spontaneity?
And all that is literally Leibnizian, that there would be a spontaneity of the point, that the point needs nothing other to enter into movement – all of these are constant themes in Leibniz’s physics, mathematics, and metaphysics, such that it’s entirely precise for me to say, yes, there is something Leibnizian in Klee. But then, these variations – I am speaking of an inflection – I can submit them to operations of symmetry, in which I would no longer have an inflection point, but a turning point to produce this. Another symmetry can give me an ogive, or pointed arch. The first figure, inflection; the second figure, through turning ; the third figure, no matter, by another symmetry, an ogive. I can… These are figures that you can locate; you will locate them already in the Gothic . If I multiply the ogive line, I would have a figure of liquid flowing. But, through symmetry, a fourth figure… … But by prolonging the curvature, and here’s what you have! This is becoming prettier and prettier! So, by prolonging the curvature… Why am I insisting on this? This is what a truly Baroque figure is. You see? Very often in Baroque architecture, in the decorative motifs… … the same things on this side… Do you recognize it? Thanks to simple decorative motifs, you say, hey, it’s a Baroque church! The enlargement, there it is. I have summed up today’s meeting: enlargement, the motif of inflection that opens you to the ideal genesis. Fine. On the other side, it’s the same… There you have a very beautiful decorative motif. You can also see a kind of starfish there – it’s possible – no longer through prolonging, but by rotation around an inflection point. You can have a wave, a fluctuation through continuation to infinity. Eh?
So, we are advancing a little bit into the idea of the genetic element of forms, the genetics of forms. But why? I would say, look at how the inflection does not stop. It is itself a fold. That’s what is curious, the spontaneity of the straight line… the spontaneity of the point . The straight line is what? It’s when the point… it’s when the point… exactly, the straight line responds to the case in which the point undergoes an external causality. So yes, as Leibniz says, in a very beautiful text, if the point undergoing the external causality, if it is considered abstractly, if the point is considered abstractly, then what does it follow? It does not follow the curve; it follows the tangent to the curve, that is, a straight line. But if it is considered in its spontaneity, then it is presumed to travel along an inflection, and through this, it engenders forms or the form. As an inflection with variable curvature, it is probable that it engenders forms.
But what does spontaneity of the point mean? I can give you the answer in advance, because the Leibniz’s answer in advance is that the point’s spontaneity is what? It’s the point as point of view. But here, we are not yet ready to understand. It’s when the point is determined as point of view that the point’s spontaneity appears, and the view is again like an inflection. This is just to tell you… It’s not so you will understand, but that you will feel this.
So there we are. I would like to end today -- because this is enough -- on a final, difficult point. We have passed from one level of matter and treatment of matter in bulk to another level, the treatment or the genesis of forms. And why? Why did we have to join them? I would say, provided that I can justify this the next time, that just as the first level is constituted by aggregates going to infinity, so too the second level, the level of inflections, is constituted by series going to infinity. And the question remains: why must we go beyond the first level? That is, why isn’t it enough to speak of folds of matter, of pleats of matter? Why do we have to go all the way to pleats of the soul that can be considered as the genetic element of forms?
There is a very important text by Leibniz, and rather difficult. I would just like to read to you so that you might consider this. I am reading very slowly because our goal the next time will certainly be to comment on this text in detail. It’s a text on physics, in a letter that is an answer to Bayle, who was an eighteenth century author, very anti-Leibnizian and who criticized him a lot. There is a letter from Leibniz to Bayle where this is written:
Any point at all you take in the world, that is, movement from any point at all, moves along a predetermined line which that point has adopted once and for all, and which nothing can make it abandon. This is a bit mysterious. Let’s hold on to: “any point at all,” “ along a predetermined line which that point has adopted once and for all,” understanding that this point adopted once and for all as long as there is nothing else that makes it change. “It is true that this line would be straight…” – there are a lot of people who say, well, if you only have a point on a line, it’s necessarily a straight line that travels along the point. This is even an expression about inertia. Leibniz tells us entirely the same thing. In fact, if the point were all alone in the world its line would be straight; if this point could be alone in the world, the line would be straight, that is, what does that mean? It would be straight, straight being defined as a tangent to the possible curve, to the virtual curve, passing through the point. You sense that Leibniz wants to tell us: in fact, the point follows a curved line; in fact, the point follows a curved line. And it ought to follow a curved line if it were alone in the world. Notice that “alone in the world” certainly does not mean “spontaneous”; it means “abstract.” If the point is treated as an abstraction, then yes, it follows the straight line, notably, it follows a line that is always a tangent, so it follows a straight line.
But it’s not alone in the world. Henceforth, it does not follow a straight line, and we can say that no point follows a straight line. Why? He tells us in the text: “Because there is the collaboration of all other bodies”; because there is the collaboration of all bodies, that is, there is an intersection of bodies. “Also it is by just that collaboration that the line is pre-established”, and the pre-established line through the collaboration of bodies is obviously a curve, and a curve with variable curvature since, following the neighboring bodies, it changes according to the movement and displacement of the point. So the line is not straight by virtue of the mechanical laws since the movement occurs due to the movement of all the bodies. And it’s by this very collaboration that the line is pre-established and determined. And he says abruptly, brutally – this comes back to saying, ok, in the end, by virtue of all the bodies one upon the other, with one another, the point follows a curve; it follows a curve with variable inflection according to the kind of neighboring .
It’s time. I sense that you are already tired, but it’s very important that you understand. Finally, so it’s like this, and then… The question is why does Leibniz add – there is no gap in the text – he just said that it’s the collaboration of all the bodies that determines, that pre-establishes the point as line of curvature, as curved line. So he continues abruptly, So I claim that there is no real spontaneity in a mass. In fact, spontaneity is not properly in mass, you see. What mass means is the composite of the body considered with the other bodies under the regime of the collaboration of bodies. In this, one can say that there is a determination of a body by others; there is no spontaneity. Spontaneity can not be in the mass since the mass is an agglomerate of agglomerates, an aggregate of aggregates. So this is a regime of external determination. Thus, So I claim that there is no real spontaneity in a mass, unless it grasped the entire universe, that is, unless it grasped the aggregate of all aggregates. For, if this point could begin by existing alone, if it were extracted from the mass, it would continue not at all in the pre-established line, in the curve, but in the straight tangent. This is clear. And on this point, he is going to become the most mysterious.
Here we have precisely, it seems to me, what this indeed difficult text tells us for the moment: if the point were abstract and all alone, it would follow a straight line. Let’s say Kandisky places himself into the hypothesis of the abstract point; he would follow a straight line. It would be a tangent with virtual curvatures. Second proposition: in fact, the concrete point follows a curve with variable curvature, and these are concrete movements. Why? Because the line that it follows is pre-established through the variable collaboration of other bodies. Third proposition: the collaboration of bodies with a body defines a mass, and this is not yet spontaneity. The concrete point must have a spontaneity that explains in the final instance that it follows a curve with variable curvature. And this spontaneity, it’s not the mass that can account for it. Moreover, bodies would not collaborate with each other; there would not be --  on the contrary, the mass demands, assumes this spontaneity – bodies would not collaborate with each other if there were not a spontaneity of the point that follows the curve with variable curvature. So, instead of the collaboration of bodies explaining the spontaneity of the inflection, the collaboration of bodies presupposes the spontaneity of the inflection. In other words, and this is all that I want us to sense from this text, the treatment of matter refers to a genesis of forms, and assumes a genesis of forms.
And how is it going to express the spontaneity of the point that is located neither in the point all alone, nor in the mass? The spontaneity of the point, here is what tells us about it: So strictly speaking in the substantial form,” the form, eh? “So strictly speaking in the substantial form”, in parentheses, “of which this point is the point of view” – “that spontaneity is located”. We have something like three stages: the point all alone that would follow a straight line; the collaboration of other bodies, that is, the mass that predetermines a curved line; and the mass itself, would remain incomprehensible if it did not refer to a superior spontaneity. This superior spontaneity is when the point is neither all alone, nor caught in a mass, but when it has become point of view. For the moment, this is unintelligible.
So let’s take another step forward. If the spontaneity of the point is the point determined as point of view, what are the centers of curvature, of inflection? It’s they that trace an enveloper, in its variation, and that jumps from one side to the other, back and forth at a point of inflection, and this is the center of curvature on the side of the concavity. This is precisely a point of view. It’s the point as point of view; it’s the point as point of view, and its at the level of the point as point of view that all of the bundles of straight lines are going to meet, the convergent straight lines from the curvature all the way to the center of curvature.
In other words, all that I wanted for you to feel is that the idea that there was a matter susceptible to folds and pleats was insufficient. This was a level that we necessarily had to go beyond toward another, deeper level, or rather, a higher level. It was not sufficient. In other words, matter does not account for folds and pleats that affect it. Here we are, I am again becoming clear, becoming limpid. Matter does not account for folds and pleats that affect it; that is, the collaboration of bodies accomplishes the curvature, but does not account for it. The curvature has to refer to a free spontaneity. This free spontaneity will be determined as the spontaneity of the point as point of view. But for the moment, we don’t even understand that. We can just say that this spontaneity is directly expressed in the inflection and the series that emerge from it. In other words, that these are the folds of the soul cite the inflection as free spontaneity – I assimilate it precisely into the folds of the souls or into the genetic element of the fold – I can say that it’s the folds of the soul that alone account for the ideal genesis of forms, and that the folds and pleats of matter presuppose this second region of folding of folds and pleats. Sense that we are moving toward a kind of absolute transformation of the notions of subject and object.
Good. This is, however, confusing. Have you understood somewhat, or not at all, because I have to grasp if I have to start over with this the next time? But if you say nothing to me, I won’t know if you have understood or not… It doesn’t matter to me, but I would like to know if… I mean, I have the impression that all that at the end was not very comprehensible, but… It’s just that I am in a bad situation; I am indeed forced to assume certain things about Leibniz, so I cannot manage it. I’m caught in … 

Lecture 02, 4 November 1986: Review and Passage from the Fold to the Infinite Series
 
So, those of you who have been kind enough to come today have to be sure that Leibniz interests you, and that you draw the consequences of this, that is, that you are reading some Leibniz. On this point, I’d appreciate it at the next meeting if those of you registered for the course give me a note on which you tell me that you are enrolled at Paris VIII and especially state the cycle to which you belong – first, second or third – and specifics about what you are doing this year. Are there any first cycle students here? Three… four, five… That’s fine because I need some, since, you recall, the first part of our course is particularly devoted to students in the first cycle. So there you are. So, let’s continue.
So in sum, I would like to be more precise about our goal this year with the condition that this goal might be modest, I mean, something small that might strike you while reading Leibniz. What is immediately striking is a kind of proliferation of principles. One gets the impression, literally, that Leibniz never stops pulling principles out of his sleeve. It’s a rather odd impression, this proliferation of principles because, generally, while principles were known in philosophy a long time before Leibniz, philosophy demanded an economy of principles. Leibniz is without doubt the first great philosopher who never stopped adding one principle to another. He pulls them out really in the mode “You want a principle? I’ve got it here!” And after all, inventing principles is not an insignificant matter.
I am saying that philosophy has always known principles, notably the three logical principles: the principle of identity, the principle of contradiction, the principle of the excluded middle. A is A, principle of identity; A is not A, principle of contradiction; A is A or non-A, principle of the excluded middle. And then, perhaps, already at another level, philosophy was familiar with principles, distinguishing purely logical principles, that one might call the principles of existence, for example, the principle of causality, the principle of finality.
And about Leibniz, one gets the sense that he never ceased adding on to them. His philosophy is an overflowing invention of principles. This is odd, and why? I am saying that it’s an immediate impression from reading him. He never ceases circling around a principle to present it under several forms, or else he ceaselessly adds principles for ones already known. And I would almost say that in Leibniz, principles are teeming so much that they create an exclamatory proposition, that is, something to which one immediately wants to add an exclamation point. If we take that seriously, does this mean that we could consider the exclamation point as a special sign? Insofar as it’s a philosophical sign, one must say that the philosopher who enunciates and multiplies principles is the philosopher exclaiming.
So are there philosophical exclamations, and what would that be, a philosophical exclamation? As a result, we readers, we perpetually get the impression from reading Leibniz that we ourselves are making exclamations, so that, concerning our goal this year, we derive a modest goal from this: to be able to discover, even when Leibniz does not provide us with the expression… There would be two cases: the cases in which Leibniz gives us the explicit expression, and then the other cases where we feel the need, to justify the need, to translate into an expression something that Leibniz does not directly provide us. But our task would be to accumulate the expressions of principles, that is, the great exclamatory expressions that cut through Leibniz’s philosophy. So this means that I could assign these expressions for each class, each of our meetings, the goal or the focus being to establish two, three or four of these. At the end of the year, if all goes well, we would have about a hundred, or if things go even better, two hundred exclamatory expressions, that crisscross Leibniz’s philosophy, and that we would learn by heart, and would write up in the final meeting.
But why is there this proliferation of principles? Could we consider a hypothesis? Why can Leibniz’s philosophy be presented as a proliferation of principles and derivatives of principles, axioms, laws, etc.? I believe that our previous meeting gave us a hypothesis on this point. Is it perhaps because he causes the principles to play into the infinite? But what does that mean? If this is right, ah well, we have to say: Leibniz causes the principle of identity to play into the infinite? But what could that meaning, placing the principle of identity in play into the infinite?  Once again, the principle of identity is A is A, the thing is what it is. What could this operation be that carries identity into the infinite, and the same for the other principles? But it’s perhaps the milieu of infinity that assures this proliferation of principles. I have no reason to answer more precisely since this it the goal of our entire year. To see in what sense… 
But why is there an introduction into the infinite? This is where I would like to return to certain things discussed in the last meeting. And indeed, we saw why this presence of infinity at all levels of Leibniz’s thought or philosophy. Besides, it’s precisely for this reason, the presence of the infinite, which we had as a second hypothesis about Leibniz’s philosophy: that it was perhaps the very manner of a Baroque philosophy. It’s the very manner of Baroque philosophy or, if you prefer, what does the manner of Baroque philosophy mean? What is the Baroque? The last time, we refused to look for an essence of the Baroque to the extent that such an essence was consisted of discussions and disputes, both useless and without interest, fine, of knowing what were the Baroque eras, what were the Baroque genres, etc. And we preferred taking a purely operative viewpoint , telling ourselves that whatever the Baroque might be, what interests us is: what does it create? What does it create that no other form of agency would make? How does one recognize the Baroque? 
Our first response was that it’s quite simple. It’s an operation consisting of creating folds, of folding. Folding is what the Baroque operation is. Under what conditions? Is every fold Baroque ? No, there are folds that don’t have these details. But I would say that the Baroque is the fold when the fold goes to infinity. The fold going to infinity -- That’s it, you really shouldn’t press your back on the light switch -- The fold going to infinity is the Baroque operation par excellence. We saw this the last time. And henceforth, if I said that the fold goes to infinity and that this is what defines the Baroque operation, I already couldn’t stop myself, and so much the better. It’s the sign that such performance was good. Why? Because immediately a doubling of the fold occurred. The fold going to infinity doubled into two directions: the pleats of matter and the folds in the soul. And the pleats of matter go to infinity just as the folds in the soul go to infinity, such that two texts by Leibniz seemed fundamental to us: a particularly clear text taken from Système nouveau de la nature . What does he tell us? He tells us, “The organs,” the organs of a body, “are differently folded, and or more or less developed”; the organs are differently folded, and or more or less developed. And on the other hand, the text from the Monadology, paragraph 61, in which he tells us, “The soul could not develop suddenly all its pleats for they go in to infinity.” Thus, the pleats of matter and folds in the soul, these are the two forms of the fold. 
Why does the fold have two forms? This is what is already important, but we can only proceed little by little. At least we recognize a fundamental characteristic of the Baroque, a fundamental characteristic of the Baroque according to Wölfflin and of Baroque architecture, which is the distinction of two floors. Everything occurs as if there were a lower floor and an upper floor. If you will, this corresponds to a drawing of …, very schematically… of the Baroque church, and we saw this the last time. There is a lower floor, in which in some ways the mass is enlarged, and there’s the floor above. What is this duality? We could say that it’s one of matter and movement. However, there is movement in both cases, but on the lower floor, the movement is related to resistance, and on the upper floor, the movement is related to its own spontaneity. We could also say that it’s the body and soul, or indeed we could say that the lower floor is the Composite, and the upper floor is the Simple.
For us, the lower floor is that of the pleats of matter that go on to infinity, and the upper floor is that of the folds in the soul that equally go on to infinity. What does this mean? If on the lower floor there are infinite pleats of matter, if above there are infinite folds in the soul – you notice, I am trying not to comment on my small difference, the “of” in pleats of matter, and the folds in the soul. Why? Because I am going to discuss it later, but notice nonetheless that the two expressions are not symmetrical. In any case, if my two Baroque floors are distributed in this way – Wölfflin will say mass and movement – I can say that yes, everything is – and that’s the Baroque signature – everything is a labyrinth. The pleats in matter constitute a labyrinth, and the folds in the soul constitute another labyrinth. The infinity of the fold is decomposed into two labyrinths. 
And still it is necessary that this be true, literally; ah yes. It is so true that Leibniz works through a Baroque philosophy or a Baroque conversion of philosophy. Everyone knows the importance of the labyrinth in Baroque architecture and Baroque thought. Well it is so true that Leibniz presents the entirety of philosophy under the auspices of two labyrinths. And there he calls it… And these two labyrinths no doubt have rapports of resonance or correspondence, of fundamental redoublings one by the other. And to these two labyrinths, Leibniz gives them a name, the lower labyrinth and the upper labyrinth. For the lower one, he doesn’t call it the “labyrinth downstairs”, he calls it the labyrinth of the continuous. For us, this is of enormous interest, even just this expression, one that we have to take literally, the labyrinth of the continuous. That means that the problem of the continuous cannot be adequately posed on the level of the straight line. That’s what he found, and it’s already a very great discovery. For example, in Descartes, continuity is posed on the level of the straight line. If Leibniz tells us that there is a labyrinth of the continuous, this means the problem of the continuous cannot be settled on the level of the straight line. Ah, but you realize, such a proposition, what does it mean, that continuity is not settled on the level of the straight line? We are just taking notes at the moment; we are acquiring things. I don’t know what this means yet; we cannot know. It’s the labyrinth of the continuous: you understand that it’s the state of matter insofar as it doesn’t cease pleating and unfolding to infinity, insofar as matter admits an infinity of pleats. So there is a labyrinth of the continuous. 
The other labyrinth, the labyrinth upstairs, is called the labyrinth of liberty. We see in fact here that it concerns the soul. And why he reproaches Descartes is for having understood neither one nor the other of two labyrinths. A particularly clear text in this regard about the two labyrinths is in a small work, On Liberty. I will read very quickly: “There are indeed two labyrinths. One concerns the composition of the continuous, the second the nature of freedom. They find their source in this same infinity.” We cannot say it better. The infinite doubles over into two labyrinths, the labyrinth of the pleats of matter or composition of the continuous, the labyrinth of freedom of the spirit, the freedom of the soul, or the infinite folds of the soul.
And this same distinguished philosopher, this remarkable philosopher that I mentioned above, notably Descartes, not being able to decide either one way or the other, or not wanting to reveal his opinion – and this is quite treacherous! – preferred to cut through this with a blade. In other words, Descartes never understood anything about the labyrinths. Sometimes he considered a straight line and believed that the continuous was on this side, at that moment. Considering the continuous on the level of the simple straight line, he confused the continuous with an infinite divisibility of matter, that is, the indefinite. If he had understood that it wasn’t on the level of the straight line that the continuous is situated, he would have seen that the continuous can be resolved or can be composed only on the level of infinitely or actually divided matter. This is precisely all the pleats of matter.
And sometimes for freedom, this time without doubt he did not consider a straight line, but he equally missed the labyrinth because he only held onto two opposite points, the two points that make up a straight line’s segment, points that determine a segment of a straight line, specifically one pole, God’s prescience, and the other pole, man’s freedom. And he said that we could not understand how the two were reconciled, but it was necessary to reconcile them. In other words, on the level of the continuous, he only held onto the straight line, and at the level of liberty, he only grasped both ends of the line. In other words, for the labyrinth of liberty, he maintained only the entry and the exit. So it’s catastrophic in a labyrinth only to maintain the entry and the exit, since with this only, the entry and the exit, there would be no labyrinth. The labyrinth is what’s between the two, that is, the infinity of folds.
So this text is very important for us, one that I did not quote in the previous class, and that determined our entire plan, in the beginning. We are still involved in an introduction to Leibniz’s philosophy. The plan that we settled on was, first, the examination of the lower floor or the pleats of matter, and secondly, the examination of the upper floor, or the folds in the soul, with the condition that there be a sufficient reason forcing us to pass from the lower floor to the upper floor. Because after all, why wouldn’t the lower floor be enough? Why does… Since already on the lower floor, the floor of matter, the fold is already going to infinity, why must this lower floor be joined to another floor that concerns the folds in the soul? Why wouldn’t the lower floor suffice? You understand?
Hence, I have very rapidly summarized since this is what we did at the last meeting. I summarized as quickly as possible what we’ve acquired concerning the lower floor since we will need this the entire year. That is, those who will be in our meetings will have to have the gift of recall because each time, we have to hold on to what we have acquired.
And I am saying that the lower floor is defined by this: corresponding to the definition Wölfflin offered of the Baroque , treatment of matter in bulk . That’s deeply what the Baroque is, not only a manner of treating, its one of the characteristics of the Baroque. First characteristic: treatment of matter in bulk.
Second characteristic: a tendency of matter to overflow its frame or its space. This is also very well detailed by Wölfflin on the level of Baroque architecture. 
So good, I am doing what I announced. This is where I find my first exclamatory phrase, my first exclamatory proposition, the grand expression 1: In bodies, there is something more than extension . In matter, there is something more than extension, exclamation point! We could say it in Latin; this is something quite lovely! It’s a constant theme in Leibniz; he constantly says that. I say: let this be our exclamation. We’ve got one. In fact, if matter overflows its frame or its space, there is something more in matter than the extension it occupies. 
Third characteristic, and I would like you to sense that these are linked. There again, Wölfflin indicated it very well on the level of Baroque architecture in general: tendency toward rounding off angles. Why? Because the masses in which matter is decomposed are essentially soft and, at the limit, fluid. a tendency toward fluidity in matter as is evident in the treatment of waters in the Baroque. We saw this already, the whole system of fountains, falls, etc. I won’t go back over this.
Fourth characteristic: If mass is essentially soft and, at the limit, fluid, the physics of the body must be a physics of the elastic body, elasticity being what? the measure of the degree of fluidity of the body, and hence Leibniz’s famous formula, MV2 , which is concerned in the communication of movement – this isn’t MV, it’s MV2. V2 imposes the viewpoint of acceleration, that is, of the demand of small solicitations on movement, the demand of degrees or of what he calls the conatus, which implies the assimilation of the body in movement to an elastic body. The Leibnizian model… The model of Leibnizian physics will the spring . And in the last class, we saw how this physics of the elastic body produced a great substitution in the atom relation as hard body on the oblique straight line – the descent of the atom following an oblique straight line – as trajectory. Leibniz’s physics substitute for this an elastic body, that is, there is no atom. There is no atom because there is no perfectly hard body. Elastic body on a curvilinear trajectory, this is what already is a first means of rounding off angles according to Wölfflin’s expression. 
Fifth characteristic: the natural history of the organic body. The organic body is more than an elastic body. It is endowed with a capacity to fold itself to infinity and henceforth to unfold itself, from which we get expression two: All organisms in a primary organism; all flies in the first fly. All fly eggs in the first fly egg. And the organic body is going to be traversed by movements that we can call as well – here, you recognize words that were current in the seventeenth century – envelopment-development. The organism envelops its parts to infinity, and its parts are developed. Envelopment-development, or what comes down to the same, involution-evolution; or what also comes down to the same, implication-explication. To implicate is to envelop; to explicate is to develop, such that Leibniz can say that we are never separated from our body, or from a body, in any case. And when we die, it is simply our organic parts that are enveloped to infinity, that is, become infinitely small, but our soul is never separated from a body. To die is to involve; death is the involution of the body.
Hence we get the idea, and this is the second grand exclamatory expression – so now we have two already: Yes, the organism is a machine, but the machine is infinitely machined! The machine is infinitely machined: that meant all the parts of the machine are still machines such that the machine can fold itself to infinity. All the machine’s parts are still machines such that we must say, yes, the organic body, yes, the organic body is machinic. It’s a machine. And in one sense, Descartes was right to say “animal machines”. At the same time, Descartes understood nothing. He understood nothing because – this is Leibniz speaking – because he did not see that there is a difference in nature between machine and mechanism. A mechanism, insofar as it is created by man, is a finite machine, that is, it’s a machine in which the pieces are not machines going to infinity. A mechanism is a finite machine. An organism, yes, it’s a machine, but a machine irreducible to any mechanism. Why? Because it’s an infinite machine. It’s a machine in which all the pieces are machines, that is, it’s a machine that pleats itself to infinity. 
Finally, the sixth characteristic: natural history, no longer only of the organism, of the organic body, but of the living. Why? Because what explains the organism? What explains the organism’s capacity to fold to infinity its own parts and to unfold them? Leibniz’s answer will be: it’s the diffuse presence, in organic matter, the diffuse presence of simple animals, of animalcules, what he sometimes calls spermatic animals. A diffuse presence in organic matter of simple animals, that is, there is always an infinity of simple animals in any portion of inorganic matter, however small that it may be. And he calls upon the microscope that shows the presence of such animalcules everywhere. And it’s true, he tells us, you recall, in some very beautiful texts, entirely admirable. It’s true! It’s true! It’s true for the block of marble no less than for the fish pond. Just as in the pond full of fish, where there are fish to infinity, so too in the block of marble, there are animalcules to infinity. There are simple animalcules to infinity. Why? Because the block of marble seems hard, but no body is absolutely hard. That is, the block of marble is no less fluid, within certain degrees, than the pond. If all bodies are elastic and fluid, the block of marble also responds to this physical nature of the body. There are no fewer simple animals in a portion of marble, however small the portion may be, than there are in a pond. So there are, if you will… He does not say simply the organism includes an infinity of parts that fold themselves in and unfold themselves. He says in inorganic matter, however small it might be, there is an infinity of simple animals.
From this comes the third exclamatory expression, that we saw in the first class, that is one of Leibniz’s most beautiful: certainly, everything is not fish, but there are fish everywhere. In other words, Leibniz’s vitalism is a pluri-vitalism. It’s a very special vitalism since, literally, I could transform my third expression into another, equally exclamatory: matter is not lively , but matter is a life pool . All matter is a life pool. Everything is not a fish, but there are fish everywhere, a kind of nautical ballet. And what is the nautical ballet? It’s a very important element of the Baroque. Everything is fluid, and the dance of the living in the fluid… 
There, I have summed up. You see, if you grasp this all together, it’s a commentary on matter that is organized in bulk, the masses that are soft and fluid by nature, the elastic body as model for the body and physics, elastic bodies on curves, that is, the elements of folding, the pleats of the organism, and finally the folds of matter around simple animals. Thus, since there is an infinity of simple animals in any portion of matter, the folds of matter, the pleats of matter go to infinity; all that turns around the same idea, notably: it’s the pleats of matter that constitute the first floor of Baroque architecture. Henceforth, I would say what is this whole floor? a logic of masses, a logic of soft, elastic or fluid masses, Leibniz’s radical opposition to the atom, the hard body. There are no hard bodies in nature. Once again, everything is a life pool. a logic of masses or aggregates; in other words, a logic of composites, the composite being infinitely composed. Infinite composition of matter, the infinite composition of matter is therefore the pleats.
Fine, and from this the question explodes… We are quite fine on this floor. All is composed, all is composed to infinity. This is a possible position. We are on the first floor, the lower floor. Fine, all is good there, all is fine. We are even cozy and warm in the pleats of matter. At the extreme, we are simple animals around which matter makes an infinity of pleats. We are fish in the pond, all good. What could be better? Obviously. And what is God in all this? God is the great guardian of the life pool. It decides where and at what moment a fish folds back up, that is, dies, provided that this fish might unfold. All this is such a satisfying, admirable world.
So why are we forced to connect a second floor to this, or rather the first floor ? Why are we forced to join it to an upper floor? – And it’s here that at our last meeting, I was really obscure on this, that is, confused, because we were already tired from all this. But now, this will become quite simple. In the meantime, we have gotten strong and refreshed, you as well as me. – My answer is that there are two reasons, the first being, natural history, and a reason related to pure physics, that are going to show us that, in fact, when we propose a lower floor with infinite folds of matter, well then, one has to connect to it another floor, and not at all another floor where everything would be unfolded. On the contrary, one must overlay these pleats of matter with another type of fold. Why?
The first reason, I maintain, is because of natural history. In fact, we saw that organic matter, in its capacity of folding, unfolding to infinity, its own parts which are themselves composed to infinity, implied a position of simple animals in matter, and diffused in inorganic matter. In other words, in scholarly terms borrowed from natural history, I would say: Ovism -- that is, the envelopment of all the eggs in the egg of a given species, the envelopment of all flies in a first fly, all that – ovism is overcome by animalculism, that is, by the idea that organic matter has this capacity of folding itself and unfolding itself to infinity only because there is an infinite diffusion of simple animals in inorganic matter.
But here I find that I am drawn to call upon the Simples. And you already sense Leibniz’s grand idea: the Composites imply the Simples. It’s true, it’s true. The Composites imply the Simples. Only, only, only, well there we are, only, as composition goes toward infinity. … 
. . . If a body or a point – it’s there, the text that I read to you , so obscure, from the answer given to Bayle – Leibniz tells us, if a body or a point were alone in the world, it would follow the tangent. In its movement, it would follow the tangent, that is, it would follow a straight line. Second proposition: the fact is that the body does not follow a straight line. The elastic body follows a curve or an element of a curve. Third proposition: why? We will say that it’s precisely because it is not alone. If it were alone, it would follow a tangent, fine. But it follows the curve, and this is because it’s not alone. In other words, this is the action of converging bodies; it’s the action of ambient bodies on it that impose the curvature of its trajectory. Thus, the curve followed by the elastic body would be encompassed by the action of bodies converging on the body considered.
New proposition : But that isn’t enough, because just consider: If the curvature of the trajectory of the elastic body. … Leibniz offers a simple example; for example, you toss a stone into the air. It goes up, you see – it is a good example of the elastic body, of the spring-loaded body ; what he means by “all bodies are elastic” is very simple – it goes up and passes through all the degrees, that he will call degrees of lateness . And then it redescends and passes through a completion of all the degrees of speed. It de-accelerates and it re-accelerates. This is the very case of curved movement of a body called elastic, of a spring-loaded body. It’s really an elastic model, in contrast to a model from atomic physics.
So, I think this: if you say that the elastic body follows a curve because the bodies around it exert their action on it and turn it away from the tangent, you are perhaps explaining it all, but by assuming that normal movement would be rectilinear. In fact, exterior bodies can only exert an external causality on the body considered. Henceforth, you say that it is turned from the tangent by the action of exterior bodies. Fine. That suffices to show that you are not taking account of the elastic essence of the body, for from the point of view of the elastic body, the curve is not a turning away from the tangent; it’s not a detoured tangent. The curve is primary in relation to any rectilinear element. In other words, there must be spontaneity of the curve, and without the spontaneity of the curve, the causality of exterior bodies would not be exerted. A spontaneity of the curve is required to account for this: that the curve is not a derivative of the tangent. 
What is this spontaneity? You will obviously no longer find it, and you will not find it in the physical point or in the elastic body. What is necessary? We cannot escape this. Another point is necessary, hence the obscurity of Leibniz’s text as when he tells us, and the physical point is only the point of view of this other point.” It’s a thing that we are for the moment unable to understand or comment on, but we have to find it, and perhaps we will find it today to the extent that we will be equipped for commentary: this idea that, henceforth, the point on the curve is only the point of view of another point, one that is endowed with spontaneity, that is, whose curvature expresses spontaneity.
There you are. I am saying it is quite simple: on the level of natural history, the necessary reference to simple animals; on the level of physics of the elastic body, the necessary reference to a spontaneity of the curve, both precisely require another floor. The pleats of matter cannot explain… constitute the composition to infinity; they cannot explain the Simple. In other words, the Simple is on the upper floor. How can we avoid a paradox? But there is no reason to avoid one. The Composite is not composed of Simples since it is composed to infinity. In other words, the composite is not simplified. And how to avoid the reciprocal? The Simples are not composed. A floor of Composites to infinity, that is, the Composites that are not simplified, these are the masses. A floor of Simples is not composed.
So fine, the Composites are not simplified; the Simples are not composed. Each is on its own floor. What is going to occur? This is at the start of the Monadology, paragraphs 2 and 3. “There must be simple substances, because there are composites. A composite thing is just a collection of simple ones that happen to have come together,” there you are: There must be simple substances, because there are composites. A composite thing is just a collection of simple ones that happen to have come together. “Something that has no parts,” that is, where it is simple, “can’t be extended, can’t have a shape, and can’t be split up.” In other words, yes, the Composite refers to something simple provided that the Simple does not exist on the same level, on the same floor as the Composite. The Simple is no more composed than the Composite is simplified. Each on its own floor, what is going to occur? The Composites’s floor and the Simples’s floor: between the two floor, a fold is required. A fold is needed… So, this gets complicated, but we have no choice. It is necessary that a fold separate and bring each of them together, the pleats of matter and the folds in the soul. It is necessary that a fold separate and bring each of them together, floor one and floor two. Everything is folded, everything is fold, everything is… and no doubt it’s the fold that separates the two floors and no doubt distributes it onto each of the two floors. 
So this becomes really beautiful. Why? Because this leads us quickly into a question that will complete this first study. We tell ourselves, after all, and yes, we have the impression that something there, thanks to Leibniz, something appears to us perhaps concerning philosophy in general. Since… well, what? Either philosophy , or else would it have to be poetry as well? What does that mean? The fold. Each of us believes to know that a recent great philosopher made the fold the armature of his philosophy: Heidegger, and Heidegger never stopped saying that we understand nothing of what I call “being” and what I call “the Being” – this time, not Leibniz’s “Being” , not the pond , but the “Being”, that which is – we undertand nothing of what I call “being” and “Being” if we do not see that the essential is the fold that refers them to one another. And it refers them to one another as what? No doubt as the ontology of being and as the phenomenology of “Being”, being as being of the “Being”, the “Being” as “Being” of being. The “of” is the fold.
And picking up these Heideggerian themes, Merleau-Pointy speaks to us of the fold that constitutes vertical being, the fold that constitutes vertical being. You see, it’s not complicated. I am doing this. I am doing philosophy when I do this, the vertical being, here it’s the “Being”. I have folded my sheet, “Being” and being, vertical being; good, you will say fine, the fold, perhaps it’s something that… Only, here we are, we cannot stop; we don’t want to stop. We do not stop the fold. For the fold, we are bringing in Heidegger and all that. What I am saying is that in Heidegger, he underwent a very deep experience that we do not stop the fold. That is, the fold swarms in all directions since, on the side of being, what is the double movement, the complementary dual dynamism, of veiling-unveiling? So I am saying some extremely rudimentary things. On the side of ontology, it’s this complementarity, this co-penetration of veiling and unveiling, in which we have to take the word “veil” with Heidegger’s requirements, that is, in an extremely effective sense of etymology. The veil, really, the veil as substance, the substance of the veil… veil oneself, unveiling, veiling… What is this precisely if not the fold? This time, it’s no longer the fold of being and of the “Being”, but a kind of repercussion of the fold of being and of the “Being” in being itself.
And what is the status of the “Being”? How does the “Being” constitute the world. It constitutes the world in a phenomenological form, which is what? Which is – and this is well know, coming straight from Husserl – the envelopment of profiles, such that the fold of being and of the “Being” doubles over into being under the form of folds of the veil and into the “Being” under the form of the envelopment of profiles. I am telling myself that it’s not at random that Merleau-Ponty draws on Leibniz in his notes. He says that the only one who understood something before Heidegger, certainly, the only one who understood something was Leibniz. It’s strange. And in the end, this tale of the fold… because we are too ignorant. I don’t mean at all that we shouldn’t praise Heidegger, since it goes without saying that Heidegger conceived of the fold in a deeply original way. But I believe that we can say that a discovery by Heidegger was the very position of the fold as operating the most fundamental relationship between being and the “be-er”, or if you prefer, of the two floors.
I think that in a certain way, it’s a philosophical-poetic idea running through . Poetry has always started from the idea that there is no straight line in the world, that bodies were rubbery or cavernous, that everything is labyrinthine, and what does that mean? Last year, we saw this a bit here and there, and it’s not the Heideggerians. Michaux … Some among you pointed out to me a very heavy text by Michaux. It’s very recent in Michaux, a very lovely collection by Michaux called Life in Folds. And this theme from Michaux, owing nothing to Heidegger, consists in explaining in a no doubt splendid poem that we are born with twenty-two folds – it’s a Chinese figure, twenty-two, surely; it’s a figure loaded with… eh? No? It’s certainly a figure linked to the folds of water-lilies , something like that – we are born with twenty-two folds and, Michaux says, when we have undone all our folds, we die. But to console us, he adds, it happens that we die before having undone all our folds. What does that mean? It’s what we call a premature death. We must say that he didn’t do enough philosophy; he didn’t undo all his folds. Only the misunderstanding – and if one does enough philosophy, one knows this is how it is – that the unfolding isn’t the opposite of the fold. And moreover, the unfolding is only the conduit corresponding to the fold.
And it’s not only Michaux. I am mixing up everything; it’s in order to show the extreme variety of this thought. One of you pointed out to me the extent to which this theme is quite profound in Mallarmé. The theme of the fold appears in a constant dual form in Mallarmé, and it’s infinitely more important, it seems to me, than the theme of silence. Moreover, silence is… We cannot understand silence according to Mallarmé if we do not take account of the fold. And the fold is double in Mallarmé. It’s the fold of lace work, I would say; it’s the fold as phenomenological. There is always the fold of lace work. And then, it’s the fold of the book; that is the ontological fold. And the two never cease referring to each other, and there is a beautiful phrase in Mallarmé: This pleat of somber lace which retains the infinite woven by a thousand,” we couldn’t say it any better, the fold goes all the way to infinity; the fold is what goes to infinity. This pleat of somber lace which retains the infinite woven by a thousand, each according to the thread or the prolongation, its secret unknown” – if I understand correctly, this is the ablative absolute – “each according to the thread or the prolongation, its secret unknown, assembles distant interlacings where there sleeps some luxury to take account of – a ghoul, a knot, some foliage – and to present. In my opinion, this is very beautiful; it says everything. At the same time it says that the fold of somber lace work goes beyond toward another, deeper fold, and the folds, all the folds, all the way to infinity. … 
Such that, on this level, we again find… We see here exactly where I am. I ask that you grant me the lower floor consisting of this: matter is inseparable from pleats, and the pleats of matters go all the way to infinity, physically, organically, or inorganically. But there is a reason for which the folds of matter are not enough. There are reasons for which the folds of matter are not enough and refer us to the folds in the soul. The labyrinth of the continuous refers us to the labyrinth of freedom. Between the two labyrinths, each infinitely folded on itself, there is a fold. 
Good. The second part the other floor, the upper floor, and I sum up, to come back to it this way. We will have run back through, I assume, I hope, in a new way, in a slightly different way, we will have run back through all that we did the last time, but also moving forward on certain points. I remind you that we began the study of the upper floor, in what form? Well, we just left the material side, I would say, the material data or the physical data. What is this? It’s the elastic body on such an irregular curve as possible, the elastic body on an irregular curve. Why irregular? Since the pressure of coexisting bodies varies itself with the variations in the neighborhood. Thus, on the other floor, that is not what we are going to find. On the other floor, we are going to find the ideal genetic element of a material given, that is, of the elastic body on its curve. What is the ideal genetic element? This is what is going to furnish the first floor. You see the difference? On the lower floor, I have the elastic body on a curve; on the upper floor, I ask, what is the genetic element of this materiality of the elastic body on a curve? And our answer, we saw it: this time, it’s the point, pure point, let’s say, the mathematical point.
But I have hardly said this than problems arise. So we would need to look at this problem then or we will never move forward. But I tell myself that I have one very interesting thing, the theory of points in Leibniz since there are all sorts of points. We saw on the lower floor the physical point. The physical point is a rubbery point, an elastic point. And then, on the first floor, we encounter an entirely different point, no longer the physical point. It’s the mathematical point, the point as mathematical point. There we have the ideal generic element. On what? As we saw, on an inflection. And you recall the figure of the inflection – I’ve lost my chalk, where is it ? Oh, here! – Here we have an indubitable figure of inflection; it’s the genetic element, a mathematical point on inflection, with the inflection being defined how? By a singularity, a cherished expression in mathematics, specifically, the point of inflection, the point of inflection being defined by a singularity, by this: it’s an intrinsic singularity, that is, independent of a system of coordinates; an intrinsic singularity consisting in what? Well, the tangent to the point of inflection crosses the curve, crosses the inflection.
And how elated we were in the last class to discover this ideal genetic element, the mathematical point on the inflection, was the figure that Paul Klee named the “active line,” of which he undertook the genesis of everything he called forms in movement. And the active line, that is, the point on the inflection, from Paul Klee seemed to authorize for me every connection between Klee and the Baroque, a connection supported by Paul Klee himself, and allowed us to judge the opposition Klee Kandinsky, in which, to a certain extent, if I dare say, Kandinsky remains in some ways Cartesian, that is, he considers that the point is not spontaneously in movement, and that what is required is an exercise of exterior force to put the point in movement, and the henceforth, this movement is angular, that is, is first rectilinear, horizontal or vertical, but following the oblique. Thus, to Paul Klee’s active line that demands spontaneity of movement, notably the mathematical point on the inflection, is opposed in fact Kandinsky’s angular line. There is no basis for establishing a hierarchy, but there is a basis to establish a divergence in this, a difference in inspiration. And yet again, it’s very important for us that Klee constantly refers to the Baroque themes. So, if this is how it is, , the ideal genetic element, the mathematical point that runs through an inflection, you see? There, I would say that this is the ideal fold, or idea-al, , or at least that’s what I call the genetic element of the fold. The inflection is the genetic element of the fold. In other words, the genetic element of pleats of matter is the inflections traversed by mathematical points.
But what can we draw from an inflection? Well precisely, it’s a genetic element because lots of things can be drawn from it. And I was telling you, according to a young philosopher who has undertaken some very astonishing work, there is an entire variation of the genesis of forms, what Klee called forms in movement. So, according to Bernard Cache, we saw that last time that, starting from the inflexion, there emerges an engendering of forms through symmetry – I won’t go back over this, I am only summarizing – through symmetry, through prolonging curvature – you remember? – the Baroque theme. The ogive was a transformation through symmetry, through prolonging the curvature, through rotations, which gave us the starfish figure, through octagonal sliding – that yielded a kind of unhooking – through rupture or, if you prefer – but this is too complicated, but that doesn’t matter – through oblique cuts, with the very question that I am quickly posing here – but this is of little interest; these are hypotheses; you can create geneses yourself of families of curves or families of forms: isn’t there a passage, a point of view from one genetic method of inflection, if one proceeds or goes all the way to the oblique cut here that develops an effect of rupture in the inflection? Don’t we arrive at a genesis of the hyperbole? See, the hyperbole is a very special figure. It’s this curve constituted from two pieces with one going downward and the other upward, and with one getting infinitely closer to one of the two axes without ever reaching it, and the other approaching the other axis, with a kind of gap in the middle, that is, at the intersection of both axes that is represented by zero, for one simple reason: that there is no division possible by zero. So, we would go all the way to the genesis of the hyperbole. Fine. 
Immediately, if I am proposing to you this engendering, according to Bernard Cache, that connects immediately to the idea of a possible conjuncture with something known and greatly discussed today, with catastrophe theories by Thom. Thom’s catastrophe theory proposes for us an interesting genesis, so is there something troubling in it? It’s just that in all Thom’s books, you find a drawing; I am going to show it to you from afar because it is quite lovely, this drawing, but finally, we won’t comment on it because we’d get… You wouldn’t see anything, but it’s just to tell that it’s beautiful. And on this situation of catastrophes, I am reading…. What’s bothersome is a small weakness, that can always be corrected… It’s just that he doesn’t speak about the fold. He provides a minimum of simples that are the straight line. But secondly, in this genesis, this catastrophic genesis, what is the second, that is, the true genetic element? I swear that I am not twisting this: it’s what he calls “the fold”. It’s written down, ok? “The fold.” And then, from the fold, he is going to derive – I am offering this just to inspire curiosity in some of you ; you can take it or leave it, or just take what suits you – the genesis then yields the pucker or gather – this is kind of like something from Mallarmé – the fold yields the pucker or gather. After the gather comes the dovetail which is an extremely interesting form. After the dovetail comes the butterfly; after that, the hyperbolic umbilical, the hyperbole; then, the elliptical umbilical; then, the parabolic umbilical – hyperbole, ellipsis, parabola. So hold on to this because we will certainly encounter this theme in Leibniz. 
Fine. All that I am saying is to that you might see in what way I can say that the ideal genetic element is the mathematical point on an inflection, on any inflection whatsoever, and from this genetic element are derived all kinds of forms in movement. But, but, but, but – consider the consequence that seems to me enormous: it’s that we are tending toward a radical revision of the status of the notion of object. It’s a genesis of the object. Well, the object is going to emerge by taking on a form that it has never had in philosophy, and we must give all glory to Leibniz for have done so. In other words, what does the object become? It becomes entirely mobile insofar as it describes a series of inflections. In other words, the object is affected by a fundamental curvature, entirely mobile insofar as it describes a series of inflections. Why do I say a series of inflections? Well the series of inflections is all the figures that result from the primitive inflection, that result through symmetry, through prolonging, rotation, the oblique cut, etc. In other words, it’s the mobile form insofar as it describes a family of curves. That’s what the object is.
The object is the mobile form or point insofar as it describes a family of curves, but what constitutes a family of curves? It’s precisely the parameters that frame these curves, and the possibility of passing from one of these curves to the other through an operation that is always an operation of fold. What are these parameters? The parameters defining the curves, well, these are relations of proportion, intervals. You have seen this; for example, typically, I marked the formation of an interval starting from that inflection, whatever you like. So, the object is inseparable from the movement through which it describes a family of curves. That’s the object’s constitutive curve. In other words, however, Leibniz invents lots of words, but here, he didn’t need to invent a word. It’s odd, but we can substitute for him. So we are saying that there is not an object. What is necessary? The object in Leibniz’s work is an objectile, as one might say projectile. Well, it’s not really that funny; it’s necessary, you understand? A somewhat bizarre word is needed to take account of this, that he creates a strange conception out of the object…. Fine. That’s the first point. I organize it under the headings: genetic values of inflection and engendering of forms.
A second, much more delicate points remains, and here I need all of your patience. I don’t make mathematical allusions very often because I read it in a very rudimentary and imprecise way, so it’s not that important. But today, I need certain things from mathematics since the second point on this upper floor would be: how is the inflection, you see, about which I can say that in itself, as genetic element, how is it an inflection with variable curvature, and not an inflection with constant curvature? It’s an inflection with variable curvature. Perhaps if you sense a bit what Leibniz is in the process of showing in the concept of spontaneity. It’s that spontaneity is already the active line, as Paul Klee said, and will say the spontaneous line. You see, we had to go beyond the collaboration of the body, the action of bodies on a body, going toward an idea of spontaneity, inflection as spontaneity of the mobile form or the mathematical point.
What I would like to show is how the inflection with variable curvature, such as it is suitable to define it, is inseparable and can only be thought in relation with infinite series. Understand that it’s very important to see the logical progression of our work. By defining inflection on the first floor, I am giving myself the ideal fold, the fold from above. And now, I have to prove that the fold from above no less than the pleats down below, that the fold up above goes to infinity. I would have shown, if I mange to do so, something that isn’t easy: that the curvature of the fold, inflection, necessarily results in the infinite series. Eh? If we manage to show this, that would be perfect, unexpected, that is, you will be very pleased. So there we are… It’s hot here, we’re dying… So, my question is…. Are there any questions? They need to be crystal clear… Yes? 
Deleuze : Yes, yes, yes, I am going to tell you : if the semi-circle doesn’t turn all alone, that’s because it’s a semi-circle, that is, a constant curve. On the other hand, if you take a curve with variable curvature, its path will expedite a mode of spontaneity. Why? In one sense, this is quite good because it places us exactly where we need to be because there will be an infinite series and the relation of inflection to the infinite series is going to be an expression of spontaneity. But the circle is a finite figure; there is no infinite series to draw from it except in something the circle possesses. But the circle itself is a figure with constant curvature; there is no reason to seek the slightest spontaneity there. So there’s no problem. Never… It’s not… Leibniz would say, but mathematics of the circle, geometry of the circle is worth absolutely no more than the geometry of the straight line. All that is the same. It’s Cartesian geometry.
There’s a great physicist-mathematician-astronomer, whatever you like, that introduced the direct study of curvatures into mathematics, named Huygens. His relations to the Baroque are fundamental. Huygens’s physics is really Baroque physics. And, I will limit myself to one very simple criterion for why it’s Baroque. As all the manuals of physics say, it’s Huygens who introduced curvatures into physics, and as a function of the study of curvatures, this introduces infinite series. And in the case of figures of the circle type, a kind of curve with constant curvature, they are expressible finally through proportions in a straight line, still leaving us to see if there isn’t something in the circle that goes precisely beyond… In this case, there is no basis for seeking spontaneity. You can only find spontaneity starting from the active line and what it offers. In the end, this is what I am going to try to explain.
Do you want to take a little break? But please, no smoking, ok? … You can go outside to smoke… Yes? 
Deleuze : Yes, he did do that, and here you are getting too far ahead of me. You need to save your comment for when we get there. At that point… For the moment, I have not said the word “monad” once. 
Student: In that case, if we’re talking about metaphysical points, perhaps there is not only one metaphysical point, concerning precisely the mathematical point of bodies, but perhaps there are two…
Deleuze : On this, fine, agreed, but here, you are asking me, if I understand your problem correctly, it’s that I don’t want to introduce the idea of metaphysical point or monad without having shown in what ways it would be necessary, and for the moment, we don’t have the elements for showing this necessity. 
We are dealing with a very precise type of problem, and don’t take my comments badly. It’s as if you were drawing me out and taking me back to a huge problem, and by huge problem, I understand it as a false problem. I mean, history… Are there relations at once of physics and metaphysics? Fine, this problem is know by virtue of a particularly stupid schema that we were taught at the time of the baccalauréat indicating that there was a time when philosophy was unified with the sciences, and then little by little, the sciences got separated from philosophy, a schema that is inept and historically false. The sciences have always been quite distinct from philosophy, from metaphysics, whatever you want, there have always been relations . And then we are told that today, the sciences have won their autonomy, that they no longer have anything to do with metaphysics, a second false proposition. There is not a single physicist who can distinguish what is philosophical or scientific in his work, whether it’s Einstein or any of the great contemporary thinkers, whether they are working on the physical cosmogony. In any case, everyone who counts in physics collide with problems of a philosophical nature. The idea that at one moment, there would be a kind of metaphysical-scientific accord and that now this no longer exists – and this isn’t directed at you, ok? It’s directed at this idea still hanging around everywhere – we absolutely have to get beyond this. If you take the Greeks, however far back you go, they never confused philosophy and physics. Those that were assigned… No doubt, each philosopher had his extremely complex approximation of this; once we admit that the philosophical plane and the plane of knowledge known as scientific are distinct, what is the relation between the two? How do they intersect? A second aspect of the question: has this changed today? It suffices to consider the discourse of a contemporary physicist to realize that it absolutely has not changed. We can at most say that relations are not the same; the relations have evolved at the same time that new forms of relation have been discovered.
Thus, you mustn’t draw me back into this, you understand? The relation maintained by Leibniz between metaphysics and physics is a kind of … If I had started from this point, by details like that, but excuse me, for me, I would have, in my view created a disappointing course because this is an indeterminate question. In this, I am not actually wondering… On the contrary, we are almost in the process of distributing… For example, you sense well that with the entire lower floor for Leibniz, as I have pointed out adequately, he refers to physics and natural history, and I don’t know what relation he still has with metaphysics since I don’t know what metaphysics is according to Leibniz. You sense perhaps that on the upper floor, mathematics is involved there, and there are also metaphysics. I don’t know about the relations; we will know them at the end of the year if we have a basis for it. But if you want me to apply a pre-existing schema onto… Starting off by saying the physics-metaphysics relations at that era, I am saying that we are undertaking a false problem because we are going to get stuck within a completely and radically false schema, I mean, doubly false. We are told, on one hand, that at some point in the past, philosophy and science were more or less mixed up together, and this is historically false. So, I cannot take up a problem that I judge doubly false. There you are. Excuse me, the violence of my answer is not directed at all at you, but at your schemas that seem to weigh on you, to weigh you down.
So there you are, I ask you, and for the last time, we will do a bit of math, but basic math. I ask you for your complete attention, and there are some here who already were here two years ago. I recall that, from an entirely different perspective, I approached this aspect. So, this will be easy for some among you, but also for everyone. You see, my problem is, first, I tried to explain what was the ideal/idea-al fold, specifically this history of the mathematical point on the inflection and the family of curves that derive from it; and my second point is: how do we pass from the fold to infinite series? It’s uniquely this segment; if I manage to finish this today, we will be so tired out that… There, this is what you must not lose; whatever I might say, you have to hold on to this problem.
For I am going to begin by something that, apparently, is very far from this. Why would the continuous simply be rectilinear? Why can’t the continuous be presented under the simple form of a straight line? Well, if you take… At first glance, the continuous can be perfectly represented under the form of a straight line; why? Because what is the law of the straight line? It’s that, between two points, however close they may be, you can always insert a point. -- Is this good? When you have a problem, let me know. --Henceforth, if you hear this expression clearly, on a straight line, between two points and however close they may be, I can insert a point; it comes out straight. Between two points on a straight line, however close they might be, I can always insert an infinite number of points. Since I can insert one of them, but between the one I inserted and the original point, I can insert another, to infinity. So, between two points on a straight line, I can insert an infinite number of points. This comes down to saying that the series of points, on a straight line, is compact, as we say, and convergent, compact because I can always insert an infinite number of points between two points, convergent because the distances between the two points fall below any length, however small it might be. So I would say that the series of points on a straight line is compact and convergent. 
Problem: is this an adequate definition of the continuous? I am moving ahead. Between two points, however close they may be, I can always insert a third point, an intermediary point, to infinity. Why? As pure possibility because this point that I inserted between two points, can I consider it as the center of an inflection, as a point of inflection, the inflection going from A to B? The point C, intermediary between A and B, would be the center of an inflection, going from A to B. Eh?  understand where I am in this? I am blocked. I say, yes, it’s possible, but it’s not necessary. You immediately understand my problem? Is there something that forces me to introduce inflections? Certainly, I can introduce it there by saying, every point squeezed between two points, there is no point on the straight line that cannot be considered to be squeezed between two point – every point on the straight line is a point of inflection. So inflection… From point A to point B, and the inserted point being C, the center of an inflection, such that, at the extreme, I would compose my straight line from an infinity of inflections. But there is no necessity. I can always say this as one says something else; it’s what we call an arbitrary hypothesis.
I return to my straight line as a convergent and compact series of points. I can make it correspond to the series of so-called rational numbers, that is, whole numbers and fractional numbers. The series of rational numbers is itself compact and convergent. Henceforth, I can express any number in the form of an infinite series. Example: I take a segment of a straight line equal to 2, that is, divided by 2…. Where’s my ? Ah! Oh là là là là là là. There. So, each A-C equals 1, C-D equals 1, and A-B equals 2. Is this ok? I divide C-D, I can still insert a point; I divide C-D into 2; I divide B-D into to; I divide A-B into 2; etc. etc. I now have an infinite series, apparently. This infinite series, I would say, 2 equalling 1, plus ½, plus ¼ , plus 1/8, to infinity. Are you following me? Certain commentators, whose names I won’t say since… They consider that this is an example of infinite series corresponding to Leibniz. I say that this is an absolute misstatement. Why? Because it’s not necessary; I am not forced to express 2 in this form of infinite series. I can always do it if that amuses me or if I have other reasons, but I have no reason for doing so at the moment. I can equally express 2 equals 1 plus 1 plus 0 plus 0 plus 0, to infinity, which would be a series called periodic starting from its third term.
So, there is no necessity for expressing 2 in the form of an infinite series. An irreducible fraction: can I … I can express it in the form of an infinite suite since, in fact, for example, for 7/3 , I would have 2.232323 to infinity. I can… Is this necessary? No, since 7/3 means a relation such that the same unit is encompassed seven times in a dimension A and three times in a dimension B. That the fraction might be irreducible changes nothing in the matter; there is what is known as… Between two dimensions, between two lengths, 7 and 3, there is an adequate common part , that is, there is a part that is common to two dimensions, a part that in one case is encompassed seven times, and in the other case is encompassed three times. Ok? There is an adequate common part.
So, you can always express your irreducible fractional number in the form of an infinite series. You can do so; you don’t have to do so. It’s not necessary. This is what you have to understand because when, in while yet, we directly consider problems of the infinite in Leibniz, we will bump back into all of… a very important point for the history of philosophy and of mathematics combined, and that still has not changed. Here we have to return to my earlier comment: as concerns the problem of the infinite, mathematicians necessarily find themselves in the situation of doing philosophy, whether they want to or not. Well – what did I want to say? – When we are confronted with this problem of the infinite, we will see a thesis through which Hegel, in his Logics, was equally opposed to Leibniz, and says: the series is a false infinite; the form of the series is not adequate for the infinite; it indicates a false infinite. Fine. Must we think that Leibniz wasn’t aware of this? Quite often, we realize that philosophers have so fully foreseen objections that will be made to them later, right, that it becomes quite discouraging for those who like to make objections, simply if one reads them. So it’s not against Hegel because yet again, Hegel, he didn’t care; he gave his reasons for thinking that …, but some reasons interior to his system. So it’s not about Leibniz that he is talking; it’s about Hegel through the objections of one philosopher or another. He is just clarifying these things, that’s all.
But never did Leibniz consider that sequences of the kind 1 plus ½ plus ¼ plus 1/8 etc. really constituted an infinite series. For we can develop 2 in this way: I can develop two in this form, a pseudo-infinite form. But it’s not necessary. It’s not indispensable. I can just as well say and demonstrate that 2 equals 1 plus 1 since Leibniz demonstrated it in a completely, a very lengthy manner; it’s a very difficult and very interesting demonstration. You understand? So here’s where we are. I mean, sense that we are uniquely here: the straight line furnishes me with compact and convergent series, nonetheless assimilable to the compact and convergent series of rational numbers, that is, whole numbers and fractions. However, it does not provide the occasion for necessarily thinking of the infinite series. We could just as well say, yes, fine, an indefinite sequence is sufficient. But an infinite series and an indefinite sequence are not the same.
So there we have the first point. From this point explodes this question: can the continuous legitimately be presented by a straight line? We have to note this: if the continuous can legitimately be presented by a straight line, the expression “labyrinth of the continuous” would become unintelligible. We have to believe that Leibniz had reasons for thinking that the continuous cannot be presented by a straight line, but what reason could he have? a reason already famous in the mathematics of his era, but a reason from which he is going to derive all its consequences, and this reveals all of Leibniz’s innovation: not discovering the reason, but deriving from it all its consequences. What is it? It’s that although the straight line presents itself as a compact and convergent series of all rational numbers, this straight line is full of holes – there’s the painful revelation – and holes that cannot be seen, but that can easily be demonstrated. Let’s do so: we have to do so, otherwise… I’d like to avoid it… Let’s prove this. Let’s consider a segment of a straight line that we assume is equal to 1, the unit – it matters little if I consider it as small n or the unit, since it changes nothing in the reasoning – I take my segment that I consider -- the segment, being any segment of a straight line – as a compact and convergent series of whole and fractional numbers, since I can insert between each point on the straight line, etc. Fine, I am saying this segment seems continuous, and yet it is full of holes. The reason is, and nothing opposes this, that it’s possible for me to construct – the drawing is not very pretty… oo là là … This isn’t so bad? – You see, I am constructing an isosceles triangle, that is, A-C equals C-B, rectangle, an isosceles right triangle. You see.
It’s nearly done, but we still have the hardest part. You know that there is a famous theorem that is A-B squared, the square of the hypotenuse, is equal to the square of the two other sides, that is, A-B squared equals A-C squared plus C-B squared. As C-B equals A-C, I am saying that A-B squared equals 2-AC-2. Ok? That’s all, that’s all, I swear. A-B squared equals 2-AC-2 equals 1. Yes? One final effort. You take a compass ; you put the point on A, and you trace a radius for A-C This circle is going to cut A-B at a point D. A-C equals A-D, eh? Because these are two radii of the circle. So, according to the famous theorem, A-B2 equals 2-AC2 equals 2-AD2 equals, by hypothesis, 1, and that A-O squared equals 1. Ok? And has your suffering come to an end? If 2-AD2 equals 1, A-D2 equals 1 and 1/2 ; if A-D2 equals 1 and 1/2 , A-D equals the root of 1 and 1/2. This point is on the line A-B, and you already know the conclusion, the terrible conclusion: There is no whole number, nor any fractional number, whose square would be equal to 1 and 1/2. There is no whole number, nor any fractional number, whose square would be equal to 1 and ½, which can be proven besides. We are proving that if there were such a whole or fractional number, it would have to be both even and odd.
What does this mean? You recognized it, however little you may recall this. It’s what is called an irrational number, the root of 2, the root of 1 and 1/2, etc. What does irrational number mean? We especially must not confuse this with an irreducible fraction. This is where I am making a giant step. 7 divided by 3: when you say seven thirds, as we say, that just doesn’t seem right. It goes to infinity, but as is said, it’s the false infinite. Why? Because there is the adequate common part; there is a length that presents seven units and a length that presents three units, whereas between the hypotenuse A-B and the side of the triangle A-C, there is no adequate common part. That is, you will find no subdivision of A-C that is contained a number of times in A-C and a number of times in A-B. There is no adequate common part that would allow you to offer a fraction of the 7/3 type, and with all the more reason of the 6/3 type, which is reducible to a whole number. There is no whole number or fractional number in A-D square that is equal to 1 and 1/2.
Fine. You have here an irrational number that belongs neither to whole numbers, nor to fractional numbers. In other words, it’s indeed a point. I can show it now thanks to the preceding demonstration. I can show it on A. And, when I have defined my straight line through the compact and convergent series of whole and fractional numbers, that is, rational numbers, I believe myself to have reached the continuous or the power of the continuous, and in fact, I found myself faced with a structure full of wholes. Why full? Well, understand, earlier, I said as Leibniz’s exclamatory expression, everything is not living, but there is life everywhere. I can revive the expression and say – and this delights me and renders me joyful, at first glance it’s not clear why, but… even I don’t see why, but it puts me into a state of absolute satisfaction – we must say, an exclamatory expression: every number is not irrational, but there are irrational numbers everywhere. And here, I believe myself to be absolutely faithful to Leibniz’s thought. Just as the pond isn’t fish, but is full of fish, so to the series of whole and fractional numbers, and obviously not irrational numbers, there are irrational numbers everywhere in this series. Why are they everywhere? It’s because however close are the two points you locate on a straight line, you can always construct your isosceles right triangle and discover between them, however small might be the portion of the straight line, a point that is not encompassed in the series of corresponding whole or fractional numbers. You understand? If you understand, then that’s marvelous.
You see where I want to go. Only the irrational number – and here, I believe it correct as well, because as I am saying that it’s satisfying for the mind, that it gives me satisfaction, but furthermore it has to be true – only the irrational number founds the necessity of an infinite series. The other numbers can always be – they can – that is, they refer to a simple possibility of an infinite series, but they can be developed differently. The infinite does not impose itself on the series. Ah, but when the irrational number take the stage, well then, yes, the irrational number cannot be developed otherwise than by an infinite series. It is the source of infinite series. We must call the irrational number the source of the infinite series, and this is indeed what Leibniz did. Still we have to find an infinite series for each rational number received or located into an example.
And, in a tiny text in his mathematical works, a very beautiful little text, you find Leibniz’s demonstration. You know that pi is an irrational number. Find the infinite series of pi. Is it 3.1416, etc.? No, that’s not a series ; there is no law of the series. Leibniz’s genius is to have demonstrated that pi over 4 equals 1 minus 1/3 plus 1/5 minus 1/7 plus 1/9, to infinity, which is called an alternate infinite series, in which we alternate additions and subtractions. 1 minus 1/3 plus 1/5 minus 1/7 plus 1/9, it was necessary to wait long after Leibniz for the rigorous proof that pi over 4 was itself an irrational number, but Leibniz suspected as much.
 
So there you have my entire thematic. It’s that infinite series can exactly only be said to exist when the development cannot occur in another form. Henceforth, the only irrational numbers are in this case. They are what imposes the infinite series since they cannot be developed otherwise. Contrary to a number of the 2 type, that can be developed in the form of a pseudo-infinite series , it’s when I have no choice, when the infinite series can exist only when the infinite series is necessarily established. And this case is satisfied when the limit is a rational number.
Good, so then we have everything we wanted. Why? How has the irrational number been introduced onto the straight line? I hold everything here. If you have understood, you have grasped me completely. The dizziness of infinite mathematics opens within because, listen well, how have you caused your hole to appear on the straight line which nonetheless is compact and seemed so full? You caused it to appear only by introducing curvature, that is, by having an arc of a circle cut through the line. Otherwise, you could never have been able to show the holes in the appearance of the rectilinear continuity. So it’s therefore necessarily the element of curvature that introduces infinite series. Eh? It enters into an infinite series since, however small might be the section considered – I come back to my little figure; those in the back don’t see it, it’s so small, you see? -- however small might be the section considered, and even smaller than this one, and even smaller than this one, etc., I could still construct a triangle, eh, whatsit, an isosceles right triangle through which or starting from which I will trace a circle, which is a manner of rounding off the angle. And it’s by rounding off the angle in the construction triangle that I unveil the invisible stroke in my segment, and I can say that it’s the curvature that introduces the infinite series and that establishes its necessity. Henceforth, I would say, there you have why the continuous is not a straight line, but a labyrinth. An infinite series of inflection, an infinite series of curvature, an infinite series of folds, such is the irrational number. I go from the fold to the infinite series. Eh? 
Henceforth, I would say, in what sense can we speak of Baroque mathematics ? I would say that Baroque mathematics… that we can call Baroque mathematics to be mathematics that are distinguished from classical arithmetic which is an arithmetic of the rational number, and from classical geometry which is a geometry of the straight line and indirectly of the curve. Founded by Huygens to the extent that he produced the study of curvatures, we will call Baroque mathematics to be mathematics defined by and as an arithmetic of the irrational number and as a geometry of inflections. In this sense and under these conditions, the word Baroque can be applied to mathematics, and we will conclude that yes, however little we have said about it, Leibniz’s mathematics are Baroque mathematics and, through this, they oppose Descartes’s mathematics. For when Leibniz himself tries to distinguish his conception of mathematics from Descartes’s, he says this: Descartes only considers algebraic equations and left aside equations of another nature known as transcendent, assigning them to the simple domain of the mechanical. And what are transcendent equations? Leibniz, on the other hand, declares that the mathematics he is creating must directly treat the transcendents. And, what is a transcendent equation such as it had been defined by mathematicians of this era? The transcendent equation is the equation that corresponds to a curve engendered by two independent movements the relation of which cannot be exactly measured, that is, that cannot be measured either by a whole number or by a fractional number.
You see? The continuous is not rectilinear. The continuous is a labyrinth because only the fold or the inflection takes account of the necessity of infinite series. If I define the continuous in a rectilinear manner, this would be a continuous still full of holes. I cannot define the continuous on the level of the straight line. another way of showing that it’s a means of rounding of angles, a theme ever present in the entire Baroque. Just as I created the connection with Thom, I remind you that in modern mathematics, a theme has met with great attention, a topic from a mathematician, a very interesting author names Mandelbrot, concerning what he calls fractal objects, fractal objects. Here I will go very, very quickly; I am giving you a grotesque presentation of this, given how rudimentary this has been. You’ll see what its link is to what we were just discussing.
Having drawn a segment – I’ve lost my chalk; ah, here it is.  You will see how beautiful this is. – I take a segment. It’s not wavy like that one. A first straight line I construct my trilateral triangle. And here, I do the same thing, and here as well. And I continue the trilateral triangle. There, I do the same thing, same thing, same thing. At the extreme, what do I have? At the extreme, as Mandelbrot shows this so well, I have a very special kind of curve in which all the angles are erased. I have an infinitely open curve, that is, that fills up the entire plane. As Mandelbrot said, it’s exactly the operation that occurs on a map when you increase the scale. If you extend the scale toward the scale named real, well then, each time you are going to construct onto a cape a cape, and on the cape, another cape, etc., to infinity. At the extreme, you will have an open curve that occupies the entire plane. Insofar as it’s an open curve, it has no surface and yet it occupies the entire plane. As Mandelbrot said, it’s very strange; it has dimensions at the intermediary of 1 and 2. In fact, in mathematics, calculations are logarithms, for logarithms, for those of you who know what these are, logarithms are connected to operations through which angles are rounded, and logarithms are very important in the mathematics of the seventeenth century, right, in all of Baroque mathematics. Logarithms must be linked to infinite series first of all. At the extreme, there is this curve that Mandelbrot discusses, a curve with the dimension logarithm 4 over logarithm 3; appreciate that logarithm 4 over logarithm 3 is an irrational number. Or rather, we have no basis for admiring this since there is an infinite series and there are irrational numbers at the limit of the infinite series.
I can do the opposite, and instead of adding capes infinitely to the figure – this is what Mandelbrot says cleverly, noting that: How does one measure the coasts? How does one measure a country’s coasts? Well, you take a scale that allows you to define the capes and bays, and if you change the scale, you will perpetually have other capes on your map or other bays in your bay. You can just as well subtract bays as add capes. You will arrive at the same coast, with the dimension 1.2, neither in the dimension 1, nor in the dimension 2, but it will be intermediary between a line and a surface. These are great, yet beautiful mysteries. At the extreme, you have this curve; it no longer has any tangents. As Mandelbrot says, it’s the infinitely cavernous body, or the infinitely spongy body. Hey! The infinitely elastic body, that suits us quite well.
So we rediscover , and it’s about this that I would like you to reflect between now and the next class. What I believe to have done, I hope… I know that this has been difficult, and you have endured this very well. But that’s it now. This will be… We have finished with math, I dare say. What I want you to retain is the purely logical linkages: How did we go from the fold to the infinite series? That is, why can’t the continuous be rectilinear, but necessarily a labyrinth? Answer: the rectilinear continuous is only an apparition full of holes, these holes being marked by irrational numbers which themselves imply curvatures, elements of curvatures, such that they are the source of infinite series. What we have shown, if you will, is that we had to go from the fold as inflection to the infinite series through the intermediary of the irrational number.
What’s left for us to do in order to complete this first floor, the upper floor? The second part of what I would like to demonstrate is that this time, it is not enough to go from the fold as inflection of the infinite series. We have to go from the infinite series to inclusion, which is quite a simple idea, to wit: folding, folding, it’s quite lovely. We fold, we fold to infinity. That’s what we have just shown: if you fold, you fold to infinity. Thus, the fold is the expression of the infinite. So, this is what you must dream about: the fold is infinite. The fold is the form of the infinite. 
Fine, the fold is the form of the infinite, but why do we fold? Here I would like to say the most banal thing in the world, and it’s really great. One cannot do philosophy without going astray , and then I don’t know how to say it, from the greatest paradox to the greatest banality, and it’s by seeking support from an enormous banality that we can again move back to something astonishing. At this point, we are strong in speaking to others, that is, to non-philosophers. What would you have us do? If you lean toward this banality, you have to go all the way, that is, all the way to the other side of the banality which is a nonsensical paradox. So, we discover the enormous banality immediately: what is the use of folding? Why do we fold? So this seems obvious to me, and this is a spatial intuition from Leibniz. But when you fold something, it’s to place it inside. You fold a piece of paper to put it inside an envelope. Folding is for putting inside, and this is the only way to put it inside. In other words, we go from the fold to inclusion. Inclusion is the final cause of the fold. I fold to place within. I want to make a package, so I fold. I fold the newspaper to put it in my pocket. I fold my handkerchief; it’s no stronger than that. The fold goes beyond itself toward inclusion, you see? So the two operations are: from the fold to the infinite series, from the infinite series to inclusion.
If the continuous is a labyrinth, in the end it’s because it is inside. It’s inside what? It’s inside the soul such that, I would say, we pass continually from the labyrinth of the continuous to the labyrinth of freedom. The labyrinth of the continuous is: the continuous is not rectilinear; it implies the infinite series of inflections or the infinite series of the fold. The labyrinth of freedom is: what is the use of folding? It’s for placing with the soul so that each soul has within it an infinity of folds that it cannot unfold all at once. And what does it mean to be a soul? O how this is torturous, how this is torturous. It’s having twenty-two, forty, two thousand, an infinity of folds. And the pleats of matters are there only because they find their reason most profoundly in the final inclusions of the folds in the soul. Orthodoxy was greatly suspicious of Leibniz. This soul full of folds indeed appeared suspect, especially when we see what Leibniz will derive from his soul full of folds, and you see that he found that Descartes’s soul was truly too rectilinear.
Fine, I am launching a great appeal. I would really like that for the next time, which will be in a little while now since next Tuesday is the 11 November, so we have to… That comes at a good moment because you will need all that time to reflect. I would truly like for you to review all this because I am ready to start over, I don’t care, if it’s not entirely clear, because I would like… What I did here is the tale of the fold-infinite series-irrational ; how these three notions are connected, and how from this we conclude that the continuous cannot be rectilinear, but is indeed a labyrinth. If you haven’t understood this, we will start over… Yes? At the same level; I am saying that on this point, Leibniz can create a very original conception of the pleating onto oneself by virtue of all this. If you will, he is going to complicate all the ready-made expressions and understand them in a completely new way, in Leibniz’s thought.
 
Lecture 03, 18 November 1986: Point of View


Let’s get going. So I owe you some explanations about all this . Here’s what it’s about: the department of philosophy had a team for a video philosophy course. That interests me a lot, the question of knowing if, in a face-to-face course, something could pass through video, or if nothing passes. So then we decided to try it out twice. This is going to be difficult, and difficult for everyone, two attempts of this sort. Several years ago, we had already tried it with Marielle , but I think that the equipment then was not as good. And in some ways, this seemed like a good thing to render… but in the end, the spoken word-video relations, all that, seem to me interesting, at least for me, that is. And then, I have an even more perverse idea, that since you force me to speak in front of machines , it’s a dream of having myself taken into an even greater machine than you. All this connects obviously to the subject of our meeting today which will be, you will understand quickly, something like the inclusion of points of view, or the inclusion of points of hearing, that is, as a point of view can adopt another point of view, can identify another point of view, can encompass another point of view, or a point of hearing, can seize another point of hearing. Good, on that note, let’s go.
I will try to summarize so that this will be very clear, where we are right now. I will try to summarize where we are. You remember… -- I’d like you to keep this vaguely in mind each time. -- You remember what our global problem is for the entire year? Our problem is the possibility of a definition of Baroque philosophy, that is, of Leibniz’s philosophy, as a function of the following determination, the fold, starting from the idea that in the end, the Baroque operation par excellence is the fold, creating folds, on the condition that this be to infinity ; the fold taken to infinity, with everything that this entails, notably the operation of smoothing angles: that’s what would define the Baroque act.
But hardly had we stated this regarding Leibniz, that it was a philosophy that carried the fold, the pleating, to infinity, than we saw that there was a bifurcation. That is, the fold was distributed between two floors, the lower floor and the upper floor. And on the lower floor were the pleats of matter, the pleats of matter when matter is subjected to infinity. And the pleats of matter when subjected to infinity, we saw… We began by studying them in a very general manner, and we were connected… The pleats of matters connected us, on one hand, to the elastic physical body, and on the other hand, to the organic body that possessed the property of folding its own parts and of unfolding its own parts. Folding in its own parts was the involution of the organic body; unfolding its own parts was the evolution of the organic body. And from that point, we came upon some pairs of notions: in-volving and evolving; implicating and explicating; enveloping, developing – all pairs of notions that manifested the fold.
And then, the last time, we moved on to the other floor, and the other floor was no longer the pleats of matter, it was the fold of the soul. Why these two floors? We are still far from being able to consider this question. We will take them as they come. The folds in the soul are going to constitute the other floor, as what? As form of the infinite, or as the ideal genetic element.
To each floor, you remember, corresponded two labyrinths. Leibniz told us that all philosophy was stretched between two labyrinths: the labyrinth of the continuous under development, but I would also say that it pleated itself since the labyrinth is the figure of the fold: the labyrinth of the continuous that pleated itself of enveloped itself into matter. And the labyrinth of freedom that enveloped itself in the soul. And no doubt, what nearly interest me the most is the communication between these two labyrinths. In fact, they communicate just as the two floors communicate.
Good, good, good. So we had started studying folds in the soul as a form of the infinite. And the last time, we only went, we had travelled a little bit onto the path of this second labyrinth. We had gone from inflection to the infinite series. That was our goal for the previous meeting, and that came down to saying some very, very simple things: this meant, first, that the genetic element of the fold was inflection – I won’t go back over all that – that is, the irregular curve of the line around a point, called the point of inflection. You recall the small, quite simple schema. And we had already gotten a very, very schematic idea of the sense in which Leibniz’s mathematics was a mathematics of curves or of forms of curvatures.
And from inflection, or from the curves, we passed on to the idea of infinite series. Leibniz’s mathematics was not only mathematics of curves, but also mathematics of infinite series, which meant what? It meant that the curve is necessarily developed in the form of an infinite series, and that we had to be careful about the notion of infinite series since this notion could only be founded there where it was necessarily a development of an infinite series and could not be presented otherwise. Each time the development could be presented otherwise, that is, as unfolding, each time the development could be presented otherwise, the very idea of the infinite series lacked foundation. And there was one case, as it seemed evident, in which the development could only be presented in the form of an infinite series, which was the case of the irrational number. And it was the irrational number that gave us the key to the Leibnizian notion of infinite series.
Moreover, what does the irrational number have to do with the curve? In order to make our genesis coherent, showing this link is required, which is what we did at the last meeting. In fact, we showed how the irrational number, locatable on a straight line, was only locatable on this straight line to the extent that we had a curve intersect the point that the irrational number on the line truly was, as we could say, a curvilinear point and not a rectilinear point. Rectilinear points were represented by whole and fractional numbers, but the irrational number referred to a truly curvilinear point, that is, the descent of the inflection onto the straight line.
Good. For those who weren’t here at the least meeting, this is not that important, but you could better understand, I assume. I am summing up a bit what… But I would like, even for those who weren’t here… I am assuming that this is a given, that this outcome is given, specifically that inflection is expressed, or the variable curve, if you wish, is expressed in infinite series. After all, it’s very simple, as I told you: take two points on a straight line, as close as you might want. You can always intercalate one, through which an inflection passes, that is, that will be an inflection point. Given two points A and B, whatever their proximity, you can intercalate a point C that will then be the center of an inflection of A to B. Fine, quite simple. If you wish, here it’s rather crude, but it’s the simplest way to give you a sense of the way in which inflection is developed in the form of an infinite series.
Fine. So we were going from inflection to the infinite series. Today’s task is what? To go from the infinite series to … no, not the infinite series; going from inflection to inclusion through the intermediary of infinite series. Why is this today’s task? Well, the line is folded to infinity; that’s the Baroque theme. The line is folded to infinity; it’s a line with variable curvature. But why? Leibniz really like “why” questions? Here again, in my own view, at the point we have reached in the analysis, we are deliberating on such simple things. Why is a line folded to infinity? Well, in order to place it within, to place it inside, that is, it’s folded to infinity because it is included ; it is included inside. Inside what? In other words, inclusion is the final cause, as one might say in philosophy; inclusion is the final cause of the fold to infinity. What I am saying here, it’s as stupid as… You fold a letter; you fold a piece of paper to place it inside. You fold a letter, a piece of paper to put it in an envelope. Imagine that the envelope is infinitely tiny. You fold… Whew! From inflection to inclusion. I am not yet saying into what the line of the infinite fold, the infinitely folded line, I am not saying within what it is going to be included. There would have to be… 
Understand today’s goal: what is the term that I must necessarily consider as that which is folded into? That which is folded, is folded into something. So there is going to have to be something, by whatever nature it might be, that it must contain, that it must encompass, that it must envelop the fold. Good, so we see at least… once again, at the last meeting we went from inflection to an infinite series. Today, that was only half of our path, corresponding to the upper floor. We have to follow the other half, that is, from inflection to inclusion through the intermediary of infinite series.
So, fine, I would like that to stay… This all seems to be complicated, but you also get that these are extremely simple operations. As soon as we talk about folding, it’s about practical exercises. There are two ways for you to understand me: on the level of practical exercises, of folding exercises, and in mathematics, it’s quite important; in biology, it’s quite important; and then in a no doubt philosophical way, corresponding to Leibnizian concepts. But this doesn’t mean that concepts aren’t overlaid with extremely simple sensitive intuitions. I do believe that it’s very unfortunate to try to understand Leibniz starting from considerations on the inclusion of predicates in the subject, to the extent that I ask those who are somewhat familiar with Leibniz almost to forget him. All of those who are somewhat familiar with Leibniz know that he’s an author who says that predicates are contained in the subject, that is, “crossing the Rubicon” is contained in the subject Caesar. So we can consider such an idea to be interesting, strange, whatever you want, but it seems very abstract. Why does he say it? This is why we have tried to start off from something else entirely. The advantage of this: the idea of attributing “crossing the Rubicon” as encompassed in Caesar, would at that point for us, at a certain moment, go without saying.
So I mean sensitive intuition, going from the fold to inclusion, from inflection to inclusion, is very simple. Only we have to follow it step by step and try to construct philosophical notions starting from this idea: that which is fold, is placed inside. That which is folded, rolls itself within. Within what? Within something equal to X. What is this something equal to X that exists to receive that which is folded? Well here, we have to go carefully, and I come back to my inflection. You recall this entirely convincing drawing of a random inflection with variable curve. It’s not right. Ok, that’s done. For the moment, we are considering two things: the point describing the inflection and the point of inflection itself. The point of inflection itself is the point in relation to which the tangent crosses the curve. Obviously we have to consider a third kind of point, which is what? This third kind of point I could call the center of curvature. What is this center of curvature? It’s the point at which are supposed to meet all the lines perpendicular to tangents of each point taken into the inflection. Eh? This speaks all by itself .
An immediate objection: if it’s an inflection of irregular curvature, there will not exactly be a point, but the center of the curvature will itself run along a closed curve. Why closed? Because when you reach the point of inflection, the one whose tangent crosses the curve, you jump to another center of curvature. You jump to another center of curvature. In fact, in an inflection of variable curvature, all the lines perpendicular to tangents do not meet in a point, but in a region defined by a closed curve. When you jump to the other half , beyond the point of inflection, you jump to another center that itself is not simply presented as a point. Fine; in other words, the center of curvature in an irregular curvature runs along a determined region. We will say… let’s assume… Let’s settle on terms: we will say that it has a site . It has a site. So it happens, when the curvature is regular, you have a center point, or you have a site, that is, a region described by the center. Fine. 
This is very important for us because what does this come down to saying? This means saying that the center is what? The center of a curve, of an inflection with irregular curvature, is and can also be called point of view onto the inflection, point of view onto the curve. It’s in the direction of concavity. We have made a lot of progress since the last meeting, but all this is in some ways very, very elementary. Inflection is affected by a vector of concavity. I mean the privilege of concavity in the inflection is what? It means that it’s on the side of the concavity that a center is determinable. How is this determinable center on the concavity side presented? It is presented as point of view. To the extent that the center runs along a region, we will speak of the site of point of view. Fine. 
Here I am indeed saying that although we are accessing a new determination of the point, I am no longer considering the point on the inflection, I am no longer considering the singular point that we call point of inflection, there where the tangent crosses the curve. I am considering a third kind of point that I can determine as a point of view running along a site, and determinable by all that, all these little lines that I drew, and I can also call them vectors of concavity. Point of view. There we are .
Among all of Leibniz’s strokes of genius, here you have his, or one of them: the transformation of the center into point of view. We have just taken a huge step in terms of our problem, moving from inflection to inclusion. I would like for you to sense this. But the ideal would be to sense it without yet understanding it; the ideal is to realize it. So I only hold onto this idea: you see, I have passed from inflection, that is, from irregular curvature from which we started, to the idea of a point of view, point of view onto the curvature, point of view onto the inflection, defined outside the line by the center as point of view, the center running along a site.
Sense that every point in space can be treated henceforth as a point of view. Ah, every point in space could be treated as a point of view. But if this is true, if it’s true, it gives enormously, that gives a kind of new gravity to space, a new consistency to space, and it removes from space its former consistency. Every point in space can be treated as a point of view: what does that mean? That means something quite simple. That means that every point in space is such that intersect there – it’s not very complicated – that intersect there an infinity of convergent straight lines. Whatever might be the point in space that you were considering, I can have an infinity of straight lines converge through here, which comes down to saying what? According to what we just saw, every point in space is a possible point of view. Let’s complete this: every point in space is a possible point of view on an inflection with irregular curvature.
What a strange world… what a strange world was Leibniz’s world. We call it the Baroque world. 
Every point in space is such that an infinity of convergent straight lines can intersect there. Fine. Doesn’t that also mean that every point in space is such that I can always cause a parallel straight line to pass there in all directions? It’s the same thing. Given a point in space, I can have a straight line with its parallels pass through there, but also a straight line in another direction. Notice that my first drawing, through all points in space, an infinity of concurrent straight lines can still be passing in this point. And then my other drawing, through all points in space, I can have as many straight lines as I want pass there, with corresponding parallels in all directions. The first case refers to what is called a conical perpective. You see? My second case refers to what is called a cylindrical perspective. The conical perspective and the cylindrical perspective are immanent to each other. Any point in space is referable to both systems, which comes down to saying something that a mathematician contemporary with Leibniz, Desargues, had developed, that concurrent straight lines and parallel straight lines are of the same arrangement .
The cylindrical perspective, what is it? It’s the point of concurrence to infinity at an infinite distance, and the conical perspective is the point of concurrence at a finite distance. What’s important is the mutual immanence of one and the other. The cylindrical perspective is present in all the conical perspectives; the conical perspectives are present, the infinity of perspectives is present in the cylindrical perspective. You immediately sense what Leibniz is going to say, specifically: the cylindrical perspective is God; the conical perspectives are creatures. What do they have in common? That of being points of view, points of view perpetually implicated in one another, immanent to one another.
 Discourse on Metaphysics I am just reading so that you get the tone: For God considers from every angle the general system of particular events that he has thought fit to produce to manifest his glory, turning it on all sides, so to speak.” How beautiful, right? You see? As he considers all the faces of the world in all possible ways . . . each view of the universe, as though looked at from a certain viewpoint, results in a substance, you and me, we are substance, that expresses the universe in just that way. One cannot say any better that we are conical perspectives immanent to the cylindrical perspective of God.
Good. So there we are. We have passed from inflection to the idea of the center of curvature that is necessarily point of view. It’s already a huge step, point of view describing a site. And there… Let’s try to move forward more. I am insisting on the fundamental importance of this transformation of this point into point of view. One of the best books on Leibniz is one by Michel Serres, Le Système de Leibniz , and it’s one of the aspects on which Serres has insisted most: how in Leibniz, it’s the center stops being a center of configuration to become, if you will, an optical center, that is, a point of view. This is no longer the point of view that refers to a center; it’s every center that refers to a point of view, and can only be defined from there, what Serres expresses by saying that for a geometry of the sphere or circle is substituted the geometry of the cone, the cone whose vertex is a point of view. 
What does that respond to? It responds, in fact, to a so-called dramatic situation of the seventeenth century, or with all the more reason, of the Baroque world, to the extent that infinity is introduced everywhere, in the pleats of matter, without series, in the folds of the soul, etc. The world is in the process of losing all center. In fact, how to center the infinite? Where is there a center in infinity? The center is nowhere. The loss of center, right, is a… is almost the dramatic consciousness of the Baroque world. And in a sense, the dramatic consciousness of the loss of center is what affects the entire seventeenth century. Where can a center be located in infinity? “Give us back a center.” Good, they have lost all center; they have lost the earth. They swim in infinity. Good, but swimming in infinity, there is no center, hence, as Serres shows very well, the importance of an operation consisting of changing radically the conception of center. The center, it can no longer be found as point of equilibrium in a configuration. We are going to see it under the new form of point of view.
In this regard, it’s what traverses Leibniz’s entire philosophy, but it’s what traverses all of Pascal’s Pensées. And Serres is right in this regard to create a long parallel between Pascal and Leibniz… -- What is it? -- What does that mean, all that, the center becomes point of view? You see there… What we are seeking in this second moment of our analysis is a kind of general confirmation of what we grasped in a limited way by the prior analysis of inflection, notably: inflection refers to a center of curvature that is presented as a point of view, as a point of view going along a site. Now we are seeking the most general expression of this transformation of the center into a point of view. And we locate the most general confirmation immediately in a chapter of mathematics that, for the seventeenth century, is fundamental, and comes from the geometrician Desargues, who will have as much influence on Descartes as on Pascal and Leibniz. And this chapter of mathematics that I’m thinking of is one known under the title “Conical sections”.
The conical sections, what is this? Without doubt, the history of conical sections is an ancient history of mathematics, but here let’s continue. I am saying some very rudimentary things; it doesn’t matter if you don’t understand. And I am saying that it’s well known, but the ancient mathematicians, let’s say, felt the need -- they couldn’t do any differently – to pass through a certain geometrical figure which was a right-angled triangle encompassed in a circle. They needed that to establish the theme of the conical sections that we still don’t know about. So they passed through the right-angled triangle encompassed in a circle; it was the triangle through the axis. As Pascal said in a small text on the conicals , he says that the great merit of his contemporaries, and of Desargues foremost, is that they no longer need to employ the triangle through the axis. So this makes a kind of… what? direct consideration of what is called conical sections.
What is that? Don’t take at all seriously mathematically what I am saying since we have finished with… I don’t at all want… and then… -- You wouldn’t have a small…? There we are, I’ll move over here. -- You see, it’s a double cone, but if I gave you just one of them, that’s no reason not to give you two. “S” is the vertex; useless to tell you that it’s a point of view-vertex. The eye is supposed to be an “S”. You see what that means? We are already going to substitute for a geometry of the sphere or circle a geometry of the cone. That means that we are going to substitute for the determination of centers the determination of points of view. It’s the jump from the center to the point of view. And well, look at your cone, assuming that there’s a circular base. It could have another base; there are lots of more complicated cases, but you have a circular base.
You cut it by a plane parallel to the base. What do you have? You have a circle. You cut it along an oblique plane you have an ellipse. You cut it along a plane… like that… I don’t know what to call that, but you see. You cut it into.. No, it’s not parallel… Anyway, in short, you have a parabola. And you cut it in a way that both cones are affected, you have a hyperbola. You cut it in “S” , along a plane passing through “S”, and you have a point. You cut it along a plane passing through the generative points of the cone, passing through here, for example, you have a straight line…. That’s it . Everything I am saying is lamentable, lamentable, but I mean… This has nothing to do with… It’s just to indicate to you, to indicate what? But here, it’s curious. I placed myself into “S”, point of view, and what did I do? I varied the planes for cutting my cone, and I have obtained successively circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola, point, and straight line.
What is it? At first glance, there is nothing in common between these things, between a point and an ellipse, between a straight line and a parabola, between a hyperbola and a parabola. What is it? And nonetheless what can I say, following Serres’s formulation -- and that barely suffices -- I have the metamorphosis of the circle, where I have what? The connections between a family of curves, if I stick with this case, because I can consider the point and the straight line, that is, when the plane of slice passes through “S” and when it passes through a generative of the cone, I can consider that these are so-called “degenerated” cases. No, but if I take curves – the circle, the ellipse, the parabola, the hyperbola – what do they have in common? Mathematically here, they have something in common, to be at the second degree. Seemingly, they seem to have nothing in common. And yet, I pass from one to the other, the metamorphoses of the circle, by causing the point to vary, the plane of slicing the cone, under the point of view “S”. The center is no longer the center of the circle, or even the foyers of the ellipses; the center is the point of view as a function of which I have a law of passage, from circle to ellipse, parabola, hyperbola.
What is the object? At the extreme, I no longer know. I can say… When I say the metamorphoses of the circle – and there as well, Serres showed it quite well – when I say metamorphoses of the circle, I privilege the circle. But first, my cone is not at all necessarily with a circular base. It can be concave, convex, whatever you’d like. And then… There are no reasons for the circle to have the absolute privilege. The object in all these projects are projections, what are called in mathematics of the era the geometral. But at the extreme, understand, the geometral is only grasped by God. We, with our finite points of view, we only grasp projections, and not only projections, we grasp the connection of one projection to another. The object is the connection of projections, or if you prefer, if you would like a more modern language, the synthesis of profiles. Every object is in profile. There are only profiles. To perceive is to create a synthesis in profile. Husserl would be infinitely more Leibnizian if he was himself conscious of being so, and yet he was quite conscious of being so. Fine.
So the geometral will perhaps be the object such that it responds to God’s cylindrical perspective. But us, we are happy with profiles and their connections. It’s the metamorphosis, the object in metamorphosis. This comes down to saying what? That it’s another way of saying what we saw at the last meeting: thanks to the notion of point of view, there changes radically the very idea of the object in Leibniz. To underscore the new status of the object, I was proposing that we call it with a strange name – alas, Leibniz did not use it, but we, we can invent the term: we could say that we have found a new text, the true name of this type of object, that could be the objectile. What is it? Saying that the object is an objectile… what could that mean? Why introduce a term like that except as a joke? And still, we don’t joke around all that much. Why ? In order to regroup a certain number of characteristics.
We would have to say that the objectile is the object insofar as it exists only under its profiles. Henceforth, the object’s perspective implies an infinite series of profiles, the synthesis of an infinite series of profiles. Thus it’s the objectile; it’s the object insofar as it passes through an infinite series. Or if you prefer, it’s the object insofar as it states a family of curves, such as circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola. Or if you prefer -- and here we don’t emphasize Leibniz’s modernity at all, just as he is truly modern – it’s the object insofar as it’s defined through a group of transformations. You see there that the conical sections introduce the idea of a group of transformations by virtue of which I pass from the circle to the ellipse, from the ellipse to the parabola, etc. Or if you prefer, the objectile is the object insofar as it’s affected by a curvature or an inflection of variable curvature. There we are, we can say all that. It’s a profoundly theatrical world. At the same time, think… think about the Baroque world, of the importance in Baroque festivals of the transformative decors. The transformative decors were the basis, nearly the basic element of the Baroque festival. Good. It’s the Italian theater, really, and Leibniz often identifies with the Italian theater: he says, yes, the world is like an Italian theater, the world is like a transformative décor, that is, the object is indefinable, independently from a group in transformation that affects it or independently of a variable curvature that affects it. It therefore has an entirely newly status for the object.
Furthermore, furthermore, it doesn’t suffice to speak of metamorphoses because metamorphosis is the passage from one form to another form. The sole conclusion that I can draw is that, in fact, the theory of conical sections as elaborated by Desargues and Pascal in the seventeenth century has the innovation of introducing this theme of metamorphoses of the objet and of truly belonging to what we were seeking as criterion of Baroque mathematics. You see? Of course, I don’t pretend to have said anything mathematical at all about the theory of conical sections. And nonetheless, I still have to allude to mathematics so let’s return briefly, before being done with this point – the new status of the object, the objectile – let’s return to Desargues in his theory of conical sections.
His departure point will be as follows, and you will see that this refers entirely to our problem about projections. Imagine a triangle, any triangle, which turns around an axis. It turns continually around an axis. Are you imagining your triangle? The projections of this triangle correspond to each position of the triangle. Good. Is there a law of projections? Can one discern a law of projections, that is, variable images of the triangle as it turns around its axis? Desargues explains that one must -- here, I am saying this because it interests greatly, but finally, what I am going to say, at the same time… 
There’s my axis; there’s my triangle. It’s turning around the axis. You see that it corresponds to different projections according to each position of the triangle. So – aie, aie, aie, I have to redo it, this isn’t right… I need to change this… Ok, that will do – I am just saying that in order to account for the law of projections, Desargues is going to bring six points into play, six – you can guess, there are six determinable ones – six points on the axis, right, corresponding to the vertex. -- You see, I have three , and then corresponding to the extension of the sides of the triangle. One… Ouf! See how smart my drawing is; it’s stopping just in time. One-two-three-four-five-six!  is going to consider -- and here is where it gets interesting in the mathematics that I am not discussing -- these six points, is going to show that there is between them a certain proportion between the segments it determines, a certain proportion, a certain rapport between the six points. And what is he going to call this rapport, with a term that will endure in mathematics from Desargues onward? He is going to call it a rapport of involution, involution, you remember, of envelopment, a rapport of envelopment as if, in fact, all the projections of the mobile triangle enveloped this rapport. Involution; involvere; the envelopment. One might say that this rapport of involution is as if enveloped, folded into each projection. Good. . Well, ok. From there on, he will pass into the matter of four points ; he will pass into his theory of conical sections. 
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. So, I was saying that this doesn’t yet suffice, this definition of the objectile as passage from one form to another, as a metamorphosis of the form. And in other words, the form is constantly in metamorphosis; such is the objectile. The object with variable curvature, the objectile is the object with variable curvature. That isn’t sufficient. Why? Because that does indeed give us, that does indeed give us a possibility of defining the point of view anew, of giving a new definition of the point of view. What could one say? Well, here, I’ve placed everything in a stack , circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola. I just know that there is a variant, a community in all these figures. Good, but the point of view gives me another possibility: in fact, it’s the case that I placed them in a disorderly way; why? Once we are under a point of view, the question is the possibility of introducing an order into the transformations. In what kind of form, this order? In other words, you see, point of view is that point starting from which I can establish an arrangement , and no doubt, there are several arrangements under the same point of view. several arrangements, yes, yes, yes. For example, I am looking at the cleverness in disorder; I made a list in disorder. What kind of order can I introduce? Let’s suppose, I tell myself suddenly: finite or infinite? Finite or infinite, with a question mark ? I answer: the point finite, the straight line infinite; the circle finite, the parabola infinite; the ellipse finite, the hyperbola infinite. I have created an alternation of finite and infinite cases. I could have chosen other criteria. For example, are there double points or not? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Arranging is constituting my series. I have constituted a series of certain points of view. Eh? I’ve constituted my series. The point of view is not only this from which a metamorphosis of the object is revealed, but this from which I am able or become able to arrange cases. That is fundamentally the point of view: arranging contraries, arranging inverses, arranging opposites. 
Let’s find an example so that you feel this, because henceforth… There are as many points of view as you would want. Everything depends on the problems considered. In general, I can say that you can only pose a problem if you are able to determine the point of view according to which you might arrange cases corresponding to the problem. Otherwise, you’ve done nothing. What is the point of view that allows you to arrange cases corresponding to the problem? That is, what is going to have us pass into the other aspect, I mean, of the same question. Arranging cases, yes? Sometimes finite, sometimes infinite; sometimes progression, sometimes regression. You are going to create your analysis of cases.
At first glance, says Leibniz, everything happens as a form of an irregular curve, so irregular that one gives up looking for its law. What is the rule? Whatever might the irregularities of a curve, find the point of view, what we earlier called the center of curvature. Finding the point of view in relation to which what earlier appeared to you a crazy irregularity will be revealed as referring to an equation. Finite, infinite, finite, infinite, finite, infinite; regression, progression, regression, progression, regression, progression, etc. It’s not surprising that Leibniz creates in all his mathematics a kind of calculus of problems. And for each family of problem, one will have to find the point of view. An example in astronomy: if you take the planets, you will note an insane rotation. The rotation of planets is such an irregular curve that one must give up on everything, except if you find the point of view. The point of view is in the sun. That works for the planets and for different planetary movements. But if it works for the planetary system, that doesn’t work for the star system. One has to find another point of view.
Is there a universal point of view? What does that mean? Here it gets complicated. Is God the universal point of view? Perhaps God is the universal point of view, but he doesn’t suppress singular points of view. This is still too complicated for us; we have to leave it aside. Is God a point of view or not a point of view? We cannot answer this frankly; it’s a delicate question. But each time we will have to. When you have a problem, either you will say simply anything, that is, disorder in a pure state; or else you construct your point of view such that you will be able to organize, arrange the cases of the problem. Perhaps you sense that the famous texts like Pascal’s, in his Pensées, on truth, on truth beyond and on this side; what is truth on this side isn’t truth beyond, that’s not simply the sense of a platitude, a tiny skeptical platitude – ah “what we believed true here, they don’t believe it true over there”. That doesn’t mean “to each his own point of view.” Each one having his point of view is the stupidest thought in the world. It’s stupid, in the end; these are frightening platitudes even. “To each his point of view, to each his truth.”
But if the word perspectivism in philosophy is an important term, it’s precisely because it never meant that. Furthermore, perspectivism signifies that there is ever but a single point of view from which the truth is stated. That doesn’t mean “it depends on the point of view”; it doesn’t mean “to each his/her own truth”. Perspectivism such as it is realized in Leibniz’s philosophy, then taken up again by Nietzsche – and Nietzsche knows very well what he is doing with it because he renders homage, with his own perspectivism, he renders homage to Leibniz. And then in literature, in any another way entirely, undertaken by Henry James… But all these great perspectivists are again all authors that we can call Baroque. Henry James – I can hardly see a Baroque realization of the novel as fine as that of James.
So what do they have in common? At least this in common: perspectivism has never been a relativism in the ordinary sense of the term. It’s not “to each his own truth”; it’s “truth refers to a point of view”. All truth in a domain refers to a point of view onto this domain; point of view is the condition for the possibility of truth; point of view is the possibility for the emergence of truth, of the manifestation of truth. So, above all, don’t think that perspectivism authorizes discussion. God help us, it does not authorize discussion. In a family of problems, there is only a single point of view. Which one? You will tell me: what is the criterion? It’s quite simple: the one that permits arranging cases. You will tell me: so, there are several points of view. Yes, there are several points of view, notably: the point of view has a site, that is, it runs across a region. So, in fact, in order for me to able to group them together as finite forms, infinite , double point , no double point, etc. – it’s the site of my point of view. Understand? But above all, the relativism “to each his own truth”, and if you truly want perspectivism, not even perspectivism of the impoverished; it’s perspectivism of the imbecile. It means that perspective, as much in Leibniz as in Nietzsche and Henry James, strictly means the opposite: how to construct the point of view as a function of which I would even be able to arrange opposites. . Good.
And I am saying for each family of problems, you must have a point of view. Point of view is the genetic element. It’s the genetic element. Let’s consider an example in order to be done with my mindless reflections on mathematics. There is something beautiful in Pascal that interested Leibniz considerably. It’s the arithmetic triangle. I am going to tell you about it for those who don’t know about the arithmetic triangle because we will need it, so I am bringing it up here. You need to remember it because I can then avoid going back over it. We are going to undertake a strange operation. You’ll see. -- I’ve lost my chalk… no, I’ve got it. -- So, up above… why up above? You place a number 1. Ok? Number 1. So you can take is as the top of the vertex. Then underneath, you put 1 + 1, no, not plus; you put 1 there on the left, and 1 on the right, and that gives you a little arithmetic triangle. And then there , you are going to put, staggered, 1, 1. You see? And in between them, you are going to put what? The sum of the preceding level: 1 + 1 which gives you 2. Yeh? Good. 
Then you put 1s staggered again. You see how pretty it is, and there of this new level, you again do the addition, and you put 3, 2 + 1 . You place them between the two. You have 1, 2, 3, 4 to this fifth level: 1, 3, 3, 1. And then you sense that you could continue at length. You do the same thing again: you stagger your 1s; you have a triangle of greater and greater length, and there, you put, if you’ve understood well, 1, 3, 4. You place it between and there, you will place 4, 3, 1, and in the middle, you will place, if you have understood well, you will place 6, or 3 + 3 . It’s magic; that’s a magic triangle… and you continue. Her head is in the way, so I can’t go very far… Here, I am going to do it once more . This triangle is really beautiful. There you will put 5, 4, 1, and there, in the middle, you will put 10, or 6 + 4 , and then , 10 and 5. So, on this level, you have 1, 5, 10, 5, 1. You continue, you continue like at. You have a very beautiful triangle that is an arithmetic triangle.
What is the interest ? If you have a sharp gaze, you will notice that at each level there corresponds -- except apparently on level one where 1 is all alone -- you have overlaid the powers of 2. It's odd, right? This is known by the name Pascal's arithmetic triangle. It's very important since Leibniz will work on this triangle a lot and will develop it as we will see. We are greatly interested in this because he will join a harmonic triangle to it. So, since we know that the concept of harmony is very powerful in Leibniz, we will have to look at this more closely. But we will thus already have a conception of the triangle known as arithmetic.
I said that each level corresponds to powers of 2. The first level 1: 1. If you add it up, that gives you 2 to the first power. The next level is 1 + 2 + 1, 4 2 second power. The next level: 4 + 4, 8, 2 third power. The next level: 5, 10, 14-15-16 , fourth power. Etc. There : 20-30-32, etc. You could continue with this, you could continue to infinity, like that. Fine. What have you done? the genesis of the powers of 2. With what condition? You have found the point of view. What is that? Try to understand. We are in the process of getting the sense of many things.
In the end, point of view is quite close to an act. Point of view is an act, and just as Leibniz understands it, as an act. However, at first glance, I wouldn't have understood . If we hadn't started from the idea that point of view is an act, all that would be abstract. But understand that here, we are beginning to understand perhaps that concretely, adopting a point of view is an act, if it's true that the point of view is what arranges cases. It's what arranges contraries; it's what arranges opposites. I’d say here that your arithmetic triangle is the invention of a point of view. A point of view on what? On the powers of 2. And I will say, what is point of view? But point of view is the superior 1, the vertex of the arithmetic triangle. So, at the outside, I could say, in order to assimilate it to the powers of 2, that it's 2 to the zero power, if this expression had any sense. But, after all, it's this figure that gives a sense, eh?
So, good... All this isn't finished because you sense that all the problems are rushing in or an entire family of problems is rushing in, notably: can I express any number as a power of 2? And with what condition? It's useless to say that this problem alone propels you toward logarithms. Good... But there are many other problems connected here. From this I am just understanding that I can speak of a point of view that permits arranging the powers of 2. There you have typically an arrangement of the powers of 2, just as I can speak of an astronomical point of view that arranges planetary movements; just as I can speak of a point of view in physics, a point of view on an inflection and a site of point of view, etc.
But I am saying that out of this, it's not simply a question of metamorphoses. It's a question, a question of anamorphoses. For all this, on metamorphoses and anamorphoses, I refer you, of course, to the research of Baltrusaijtis, but I am just trying in this way not to say a lot about that because it's going to... It would be better to see it in books, from engravings, all that. What is an anamorphosis, and what is the difference from a metamorphosis? It's that metamorphosis is always the passage from form to form; it's like a connection of forms; it's the passage from a profile to another profile.
For example, a metamorphosis, but the Baroque world is full of metamorphoses and anamorphoses. I recall, euh, in Fascist Italy, there was a great Baroque tradition, a grand tradition of metamorphoses, in propaganda, in which there were portraits. That struck me because it was impressive, these portraits. There were quite popular. Everyone was buying them. These were portraits. I was fascinated by them because I wasn’t very old and I looked at them and I wondered, how can we explain something like this? But since then, I figured it out: these were portraits on slides. So if you placed yourself in front of the portrait, you have Mussolini; this was the central perspective, where you had Mussolini. You put yourself on the right – you see, it was painted on slides, produced on perpendicular slides, like that. So, when you were in front, you had Mussolini, and then you move to the right and there, you had I don’t remember which officer . The slides… On the length of the slides the officer’s head was painted so that, from the right, you saw the officer, and no longer Mussolini. In order to see Mussolini, you had to come back to center. There was the officer on the right, and then to the left, there was another officer, the officer on the left, eh? It astounds me that these haven’t been reproduced recently, especially since… eh? I don’t know… So you understand. Obviously, there’s a problem for the center! But understand that at the point we’ve reached, we have moved beyond the stupidity that would consist in saying, oh well yes, each person has his/her point of view. This isn’t at all, this isn’t at all what’s in a Baroque world. It’s not that the point of view changes all that much. The point of view doesn’t change; the point of view has a site. The point of view’s site, in my triple photo, in my triple image, the point of view’s site is going to be from center to right and to left. Simply, the point of view gives me the law of the form’s transformation. There is metamorphosis. And when I was saying “power to arrange cases”, this is just as well to hierarchize cases, with Mussolini in the center, you see? 
I am saying: when do we speak of anamorphosis? It seems to me that we could reserve anamorphosis… I’m not at all saying that this is… It’s as you like, eh? We could reserve it for this, for a case that is deeper than that of metamorphosis, specifically: when there is an emergence of form out of the unformed. It’s no longer the passage from one form to another; it’s how an emergence of form… how there’s an emergence of form out of the unformed.
What does that mean? In appearance, everything is disorder. In appearance, all is disorder. You recognize nothing there; it’s all completely messed up. You have a movement; you have an inflection; you have a series of inflections that are going in all directions, changing centers constantly. You recognize nothing there. Good. But the point of view is what is going to extract a form from this disorder. It’s no longer what passes from one form to another, from one profile to another; it’s what is going to extract any form at all from a non-form. A well-known type of anamorphosis is in the painting by Holbein , “The Ambassadors”. Under a bookshelf you have a kind of indeterminate stain, really informal, a formless white-ish stain. And from a certain point of view, linked to the lower edge of the painting, from a certain point of view, everything arranges itself. This white-ish stain obviously represents a skull that is the painter’s signature since Holbein refers to “hollow bone” or “skull”. Good. One could say, you see, both that it’s the point of view initiating an emergence of form starting from what has no form, and also a passage from form to form.
There really is a relativism of point of view; the truth is relative to the point of view. But that has never meant that the truth varies with one’s point of view. That has always meant that the truth… Point of view is the condition of possibility of the manifestation and the constitution of truth in a domain, the domain of the point of view, the domain corresponding to the point of view.
So here we have henceforth Aaaaaahhh… On this point, in our problem, we have moved forward. We have indeed outlined this notion of point of view. We have discerned the contradiction not to be made about point of view. Understand? We still have left a final point to look at, good, since the status of the object changes. If the object becomes objectile under the point of view, well then, it’s probable that the status of the subject also changes. The subject is itself a point of view. Point of view is the subject. The point of view is the subject. A subject is a point of view. A subject defines itself through a constitutive act, and this constitutive act is the point of view. Also the subject has a site. It’s the region over which its point of view travels. And in this, perspectivism is fundamentally Baroque. And we should find a name then to emphasize this change of subject’s status no less than the change of the object’s status. The object becomes an objectile insofar as it is affected by the variable curvature or by the group in transformation. We will say about a subject that it becomes a superject insofar… It’s funny, but not very… It’s a superject. Why do I say superject? That is, for the couple object-subject, Leibniz would substitute, but alas without saying so, the couple objectile-superject. If I call upon these terms, it’s uniquely to emphasize that object-subject is going to take on a completely new sense in philosophy with Leibniz. 
And… Superject, ok. Here I am only borrowing a term. The idea that the subject would be a superject is an idea that you will find textually and explicitly in the work of a very great philosopher from the start of the twentieth century, Whitehead. Whitehead is one of the great philosophers of the twentieth century, and who proposed the term superject. Why place Whitehead into Leibniz? For a simple and definitive reason: Whitehead considered himself Leibnizian. So, we have every right, or we are comforted in advance if we propose this pair objectile-superject in order to define the new status of the object and the subject as it appears in Leibniz’s philosophy.
When the object becomes objectile, that is, encounters a group in transformation, the subject becomes a superject, that is, becomes a point of view. Hardly have we won this point than everything vacillates. But in what sense can we be called point of view? You, me… For example, we see it well there. 1 is a point of view onto the generation of the powers of two. Good. The sun is a point of view on planetary movements. Good. But you, me, we are a point of view on the world. Agreed, we are a point of view on the world. We are a point of view on the infinite series of the world, yes, since any point of view is onto a series, the series of powers of 2, series of breaks . Any point of view, I would say – and this is why we had to call it a superject – any point of view subsumes a series. Which series? The series of transformations through which the objectile passes. Notice that this works out nicely; it’s very satisfying for the spirit. sense it: the world arranges itself. Good. I repeat because it’s so satisfying even, but I repeat : well… yes, no, I no longer know. It doesn’t matter.
I am saying that everything vacillates because… well… If it’s true that every point of view… Ah yes, I wanted to say… If it’s true that every point of view is defined in relation with a series, specifically the series of transformations through which the objectile passes, I can say that each of us insofar as the subject is a point of view on the world, that is, on the series, parenthetically infinite series, of the world…. Good… well, yes, but it’s not simple. We believe to have understood, but we must shift to us, us, us: how is it that we are points of view on the world? What does that mean?
Leibniz seems to guide us. He says, We are like points of view on the city. Each of us,” you will see, “is like a point of view on the city.” These texts, you find them everywhere in Leibniz, notably in the Discourse of Metaphysics. Here we have a text on this: As the same town looks different according to the position from which it is viewed . We are points of view on the city. Notice that this is what is our rapport to the world, our rapport with the world, that is, the rapport that we maintain, we subjects, or superject, with the infinite series of transformation; it’s a little like how a single city is diversely represented.
What does that mean? Does that mean… What does that mean, we are points of view on the city”? Why didn’t he say, We are points of view on the countryside? You will tell me, don’t exaggerate. He could have said, we are points of view on the countryside. I only feel strongly about one thing: showing that he couldn’t say “we are points of view on the countryside”. He could only say “we are points of view on the city”. This is once again why Leibniz is unusually modern. There were already no longer any countrysides, I mean. But why? Well, this is where we have… Are you tired or not? Do I continue or not? … But without out moving around, ok? Because you won’t come back if you… Is the sound ok? It’s ok? Yeh? Ok ? Do you want a break ? No ?... In any case, just stay here ; just sit and reflect. 
So this is where we are. All that is very fine: we are points of view on the city. But what does that mean, or rather what does that not mean? At first glance, if I dare say, this could mean: for each point of view there corresponds a form or a profile. If you look at the city from a particular point of view, it has a particular form or it offers you a particular profile. Good. This would be the simplest interpretation; it would be the first interpretation. Only here we are, it’s simple, but it’s impossible. If that’s right… And yet, I am telling you, beware of texts. Leibniz seems to express himself this way. Each subject has a point of view, and to each point of view a profile of the city corresponds. If this is that… No, this cannot be that, it cannot be like that for multiple reasons. But the principal reason why it cannot be like that is because, once again, this is a feeble idea, and Leibniz cannot have a feeble idea. That drops us back into a false perspectivism, of the type “to each his own truth.”
But there’s a more solid reason why that couldn’t be . Confront the proposition “I am a point of view on the city,” at the vertex ‘S’ of the cone, the point of view. Can I say that the circle corresponds to a point of view? The ellipse, to another point of view? The parabola, to another point of view? Of course not, I certainly cannot say this. You remember? It’s not a question of saying that for each form there’s a corresponding point of view or… I haven’t changed the point of view when I pass from the circle to the ellipse. The point of view is what gives me a hold on the passage from one form to another. It’s what I call the group in transformation. The point of view causes the group in transformation to emerge, that is, the passage from one profile to another. That which corresponds to the point of view is not one particular form or another; it’s the change of form, that is, the objectile, the object insofar as it traverses its group in transformation. You see? It’s not a question that each form corresponds to a point of view, not a point of view to each form since the point of view allows me precisely to arrange the forms and to pass from one to the other. Here, it is necessary that this be very clear. 
So I have no choice, even if Leibniz seems to express himself sometimes this way. You know, Leibniz is astonishing. He said it a thousand times; he measures his texts to the supposed intelligence of those reading him. So, when he wants to be understood by everyone, he speaks quite simply; and then, when he has a small audience, he goes farther. He doesn’t care since, for him, every level symbolizes one another. So it’s a matter of knowing which level is deeper than another. Hence I am saying it’s not a form that corresponds to a point of view. It’s not possible since to every point of view corresponds a change in form, that is, a power of arranging forms and of passing from one form to another. Fine. So, I would say the point of view is what reveals the connection of profiles or the change of form, the passage from one form to another. If there is no point of view, I could never grasp it. If there is no point of view, well, the circle, the ellipse, the parabola, the hyperbola will remain eternally separated each on its own, each form separated from the other form. If I have a point of view, then yes, I can create the synthesis of curves in the second degree. You understand? 
But then I have hardly made this first rectification, and I fall back into a difficulty: but why would there be several points of view? And how is it that I am a point of view distinct from you? How is it that each of us is a point of view distinct from other points of view? This is the necessity of a third level, and this gets complicated. At first glance, it suffices to find a point of view of a considered domain. But why is there a necessity for a plurality of points of view? I have just shown that every point of view seized onto a series, and probably – there’s no need to pose a lot of hypotheses – and probably an infinite series. If I am a point of view on the world, I grasp an infinite series that is the series of the events of the world, that is, a curve with variable curvature in which each center of inflection, each point of inflection marks an event. Each point of view grasps not this form, not that one, but the infinite series.
But why several points of view? Why is the point of view irreducibly plural? In other words, not only has Leibniz transformed the notion of the subject in philosophy, but he is the first to introduce the plurality of subjects as a metaphysical problem. If you take the thinking subject in Descartes’s work, certainly each of us undergoes the operation of the cogito. But we cannot say that in Descartes, the plurality of thinking subjects is constructed into a metaphysical problem. We can posit this, wonder what the status of thinking subjects in Descartes might be, but to my knowledge, we cannot find an answer to this solution, to wit: the answer that there are several thinking substances. But making the plurality of subjects into a legitimate problem , it’s Leibniz who introduced this problem into philosophy. 
So, you understand: I cannot say for each point of view corresponds a form separate from others since, once again, the point of view seizes the metamorphosis of forms. So what distinguishes one point of view from another? What is going to distinguish one of you from me, two points of view? We don’t have much choice. These are the beautiful moments in philosophy. You can’t go backward. A same series must indeed be susceptible to variations. A same series must indeed be susceptible to variations, that is, there will be, for each corresponding point of view, a variation on the the series.
So good, that gives us something: a series is susceptible to variations. What does that mean, variations of a series? I am not seeking definitive definitions. We are still operating on a kind of intuition, and we are in the introduction to Leibniz, so we cannot ask too much from ourselves. But I am telling myself: let’s use a comparison that is going to… and that entails a great danger, but in the end… Each of us knows that there is a kind of music operating with series. It functions with series of twelve sounds, with the series of twelve sounds. Everyone knows that Schoenberg’s name is linked to this music. Fine. Well, what happens there? And what are the variations introduced by Schoenberg into the series of twelve sounds?
First type of variation: you can take fewer that twelve sounds, that is, you don’t take them all. I would say that here, it’s a purely arithmetic variation. 
Second variation: a variation called melodic… no, called rhythmic. You keep the same series twice, but you transform the durations. You respect the intervals, but you transform the durations.
Third variation, melodic: you transform the intervals. 
Fourth variation: you transform the ascending movement into descending movement, and the descending movement into ascending movement. 
Fifth variation: recurrent movement, that is, you begin at the point where the preceding series ends. You invert the series. Fine.
There you have variations of the series. I would say that a same finite series contains a finite number of variables. I can say that an infinite series contains an infinity of variables.
Do we not have our solution? Specifically, yes, each of us is a point of view on the infinite series of the world. Only here we are: each of us grasps a variable of the series. Each of us grasps a variable of the series. Each time, the entire series is there, fine, but as this or that variation. Here is what it means “Each of us is a point of view on the city”. Each of us grasps the infinite series of profiles of the city; it’s not at all “to each point of view a profile corresponds.” Each of us grasps the infinite series, but as this or that variation. This will yield an extraordinary figure that you are going to encounter constantly in Leibniz. Each subject, each of us, grasps the entire world as infinite series. There you are. Only as we see, this does not mean that each grasps it clearly. It’s in my own depths – you sense the return of the theme of the fold – it’s in my own depths that I grasp the entire world. Complete this: it’s understood in all this these are things that we cannot yet understand, but we can anticipate them. I am not conscious . It’s in my depths; it’s in a folded form. Fine. No matter.
Each of us grasps the totality of the world as an infinite series. Yes, but each only grasps clearly a tiny portion, such that the clear portion allotted to me is not the same as the clear portion allotted to you. And if there is a plurality of points of view, it’s because there are as many variations of the series as there are clear portions. What I grasp clearly, you only grasp in an obscure manner. Each of us gets even with the other, eh? Each of us gets even with the other . What each of you grasps clearly, the others grasp, yes, but in an obscure way.
Once again, I could say that the clear region is the site of the point of view. The tiny clear portion that I grasp in the world is the site of the point of view. Each point of view has a site, my tiny portion of clarity. It’s a prodigious idea; it’s a fantastic idea, you understand? We are points of view, yes, but do you understand what that means? There’s a tiny domain of clarity – we cannot ask for much more – and then that opens up a whole hierarchy. Do animals have a soul? Well obviously, animals have a soul; these are points of view, animals. There is the butterfly point of view; there is the elephant point of view; there are all of them. These are points of view. So all of them, they do not grasp much clearly. There is a hierarchy of souls, fine, of souls. So a little child? Yes, a little child, it’s indeed a little child, but in the end…
What do I grasp clearly? Here I don’t want to say too much ahead of time, but you sense that all of Leibniz is engaged in this. What I grasp clearly is finally what relates to my body. Why do I have a body? I don’t have a point of view because I have a body; I have a body because I have a point of view. There is a deduction of the body starting from the point of view. Why do I have a body? Because I only express clearly a tiny portion of the series. Otherwise, I would be a pure soul in the world. I only express clearly a tiny portion of the series. Fine, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. But precisely, that’s what having a body is: I have a body because I express clearly a tiny portion of the series. “Do I express clearly?” is precisely going to be what affects my body. Who grasps clearly the passage of the Rubicon? One single subject: Caesar. Yes, I grasp the passage of the Rubicon, no less than Caesar, yes, no less than him. It’s in me like it’s in Caesar. And in fact, that concerns Caesar’s body. Caesar had to take a longer step in order to cross the Rubicon. That concerns his body. Fine. No matter. That’s what the variations of series are.
I can say, yes, and I have solved my problem. This sentence that seems so inoffensive, each of us like a point of view on the city,” is in fact extraordinarily complex since it implies, first, that it’s false that a profile or a face on the city corresponds to each point of view; second, since it’s true that every point of view grasps the whole series; and third, since there are no fewer multiplicities necessary for points of view since the whole series is necessarily affected by an infinite sum of variation such that to each point of view, a variation of the whole series corresponds. 
Understand? So, we are almost done. We can’t take too much more, in any case. You understand me still, because there’s not point for me continuing if you no longer understand? Yes? I can continue? It doesn’t matter to me; I can start up again the next time. So let’s try to continue just a little bit more. So… We are getting close to the goal, eh? We are getting close to the goal. Understand?
My purpose today was to go from inflection to inclusion. Inflection is the characteristic of the variable curvature under the form of infinite series. And I was saying that this is the genetic element of the fold. The variable curvature is the genetic element of the fold. And I continued by saying that if things are folded, this is why God never acts in vain. Eh? It’s a great principle of Leibniz: God always does everything for the best. If God pleated matter, it’s not just for fun; it’s for a final cause. It’s by virtue of a deep finality. If the world is not a straight line, if the world is not rectilinear, it’s not by chance. If mathematics are mathematics of curvature, it’s because the world sings the glory of God, as has been said. And what is the final cause of the fold? I was saying: inclusion. Fine. Folding means placing within. And then we bump into placing within. Fine. But placing within what ? So this is going to return to us; this is going to cause us a final difficulty about the point of view since we have to answer now: it’s placing within the point of view.
And good… Ooo la, la, but then there is the view in the point of view; there you have the visible in the point of view. The visible is in the point of view. The visible is included in the point of view. In fact, the infinite series of forms is in the point of view. This inherence, in esse, that is, “being within,” being in the inclusion, how do we show that it belongs to the point of view to contain the visible? Leibniz shows this in the simplest and most infantile way possible. And this infantile manner is not even by itself mathematics although it seems to be, and does not imply differential calculus, but it presupposes the mathematics of differential calculus. For a brief moment, it borrows, on the other hand, the language that is fully developed in differential calculus.
In fact, to show this, Leibniz will say two things. He will say, first case: you take a right triangle… You take a right triangle… No, not even a right triangle. You take a right angle, excuse me. You take a right angle, like that. -- You see, I am only drawing in the air now; it’s better than going to the board. This way, everyone can see and then immediately forget. -- Like that. I draw an arc, the arc of the circle, you see? So I have A: the vertex of the angle, and B-C, the extremities of the arc. I draw an arc that’s narrower inside. It’s still an arc that refers to the right angle. I draw an even narrower one, even narrower. I am getting close to the infinity of the vertex ‘S’, and I say: where does the right angle begin? Still, this is not mathematics. This calls on mathematical language, founded by Leibniz, in fact, but here, it’s quite simple: where does the right angle begin? 
 In 1700, from 12 June 1700, I will quickly read to you: “It is evident that this angle is not only measured by the great arc B-C-D, but also by a lesser F-G, however small it might be, and the opening begins in one word,” the opening of the angle, “begins in one word: from the point A that is the center,” that is the vertex of the angle, “it is also in this very center that the angle is found, such that we can say that these arcs are represented in the center by the relation of the inclination to the center.” This would be very useful to me if we had the time to comment on it, for the relation of the inclination, that is, of the inflection, to the center. You see, this relation of the inclination, that is, of the inflection to the center, is what we had analyzed as today’s departure point, specifically the center of curvature. In other words, the angle is already in the vertex of the angle.
Second text: it’s not only the right angle in the vertex; it’s an infinity of angles, an infinity of angles that are in the point, since you can always take an infinity of angles that coincide through their vertex. And this does not bother us since I remind you that every point of view has a site, that is, a region, a region of displacement. This is why one must not say “to each immobile point of view corresponds a form,” since the point of view is not immobile. The point of view has a site that designates its path , its limit, the tolerance of its path before arriving at another point of view. Many angles, an infinity of angles, can have a common vertex. In other words, the connection of visibles is in the point, or as Serres puts it quite well, when the point becomes point of view, space is in the point.  It’s no longer that point that is in space. This is a kind of revolution that Leibniz brings to bear against Newton. It’s not the point that is in space; it’s space that is in the point. In fact, sense how much this is a new theory of space that will then have an impact on all mathematics after Leibniz and even today, specifically space defined as the order of points of view. This we are still unable to understand, so we will come back to it when we reach our discussion of space in Leibniz. But space can only be the order of points of view to the extent that the point has become point of view. An immediate consequence: space cannot be substance. There is no extended substance. Space is an order; it’s not a substance.
Good, but ok, here, this is at last too much. I am only saying that we have just established the idea that, in fact, point of view is perfectly able to serve as the subject of inclusion. Something is in the point of view, exactly as the infinite series of angles is in the vertex that they have in common. Fine. In other words, the world is not only an infinite series; it is included in each point of view, that is, it is included in each of us. It is included in each of us. Yes indeed. That does that mean? This is strange because, understand, this seems to completely contradict the idea of point of view. Point of view seemed to be a point of view by nature onto something outside. There is no longer anything exterior to point of view. Yes there is, there is something exterior to point of view, it’s the other points of view, but nothing else. The city does not exist; we have to go all the way there: the city does not exist outside the points of view onto the city, such that the city is what? It’s not an object since there are no longer any objects; there are only objectiles, the series of profiles. It’s not an object such that the city is what? It can only be the accord of points of view among themselves. The city is identical with the assumed accord of points of view onto the city. The city is in the points of view; it does not exist outside. In fact, the city is always folded; it’s existing within, it’s being included, being included in the point of view. The  city is included in the point of view; it does not exist outside the point of view that includes it. Fortunately, outside the point of view, there is the other point of view, the other points of view such that the city is never an object since every object is objectile, but the city is the accord of subjects, or of points of view, that is, of superjects.
What can we call the accord of subjects other than by its true name, God? Well, what? Yes that’s it. It means that the point of view is open onto nothing outside. The point of view is not open onto an exteriority; it is regulated, regulated from within in conformity with other points of view. How do we talk of this? Something like the world is a cinema, the world is an Italian theater, a décor in transformation. The world is a cinema. Or else we may perhaps have to say something worse, even more included because cinema still refers to an outside. Cinema refers to an outside because it is quite obvious that something has to be filmed. So after, the film gets folded, and then it gets unfolded. But there is still a reference to an exteriority. One had to eliminate any references to an exteriority. This is what Leibniz says to us from the start of the Monadology, in a famous text: “the subjects and points of view”, it’s strange, “are without doors nor windows.” He says “monads”, a word that I have not yet used since I would then have to explain it, so I am keeping myself from using it. But I am saying more simply that each subject is without doors nor windows. It grasps the infinite series of the world, but this series in within it.
And why is each subject without either doors or windows? At the start of the Monadology, tells us: it’s that – you remember? – subjects are Simples in relation to composed matter. Well, that which is simple can receive nothing from outside. Why what is simple can receive nothing from outside? For a simple reason: if a Simple received something from outside, it would at that moment form a Composite with what is acting upon it. So, if there is something simple, this Simple can receive nothing from outside, so Leibniz tells us. This is fine, very fine, and logically unassailable. If there is something absolutely simple, it can receive nothing from outside, which comes down to saying that everything must be located within it. It has neither doors nor windows.
So notice this, it’s amazing! This shows well the question of Leibniz’s levels. He comes to speak to us of point of view, first moment, and today we have crossed through all sorts of levels. First level: we are points of view. We understand that there are points of view on the world, yes, on the infinite series of the world. Ah, but be careful: the infinite series does not exist outside each point of view, under one variation or another. Henceforth, there are neither doors nor windows. Everything is in the point of view; the entire visible is in the point of view. So, that leads us to rectify Leibniz’s texts. But we are not the ones rectifying them; he rectifies them himself. We readers of Leibniz, we have to reconcile his two major propositions: “We are points of view on the city” and “We have neither doors nor windows.” There is only Leibniz who understood here as well the stupidity of problems of communication. “We have neither doors nor windows.” So this is not bad. We will see the consequences for communication. This is what Leibniz will call the problem of the communication of substances, once we’ve said that all the units, all the points of view have neither doors nor windows. But then that leads us to correct the notion of point of view. Leibniz began by telling us, in the Discourse on Metaphysics : “each subject is like a mirror,” each subject is like a mirror on the world, a mirror of God or of the world. We are in a position to add something: it’s not just any mirror. It’s a concave mirror, and that seems indispensable to me. When Leibniz speaks of a mirror, it can only be a question of a concave mirror because we saw that inflection refers to a center of curvature on the side of concavity, under the vector of concavity. But a mirror assumes a real object. So the metaphor of the mirror is only valid at a certain level.
Second point: he said “We are points of view, points of view on the city,” and he linked the two statements – mirror and point of view – when he says, for example, in a letter : “Each monad,” no matter, each subject, “is a mirror of the universe according to his point of view.” There you have both together: the metaphor of the mirror and the theme of point of view. Each person is a mirror of the universe according to his point of view. But a point of view implies an outside; it implies a window. It’s useless to tell you that in point of fact, the window looks out on the countryside. That matters a lot because the countryside is always on the side of convexity. The countryside is convex. It cannot be otherwise. So, good. If I have a window, I am looking onto the countryside, yes. Only here we are: I have no window. I am a point of view without a window. So I say: mirror, point of view, but no window. So, let’s consider cinema: I will be like a lined room, with a screen; it’s no longer a mirror, but rather a screen that is needed, where the film, folded, unfolds onto the screen, would play out onto the screen. And each of us would have his/her film, and the accord between the points of view would be the accord of films between each other. This isn’t bad. But that doesn’t work because a film has to be filmed, produced. The screen still doesn’t work. There is still too much reference to an exteriority. The screen still implies a window. We have to close the windows even more.
What’s left for us? So here as well, I am doing what I did earlier with Schoenberg; while begging you not to take advantage and use this badly, I am making a rather arbitrary rapprochement, fine, something like… that explains no reference onto the exterior, so-called digital images . Ah yes. What the point of view takes hold of, what the point of view grasps, is what has no existence outside itself. Or if you prefer, images without models, a pure genesis, that is, digital images; or if you prefer, Leibniz’s model, the model that rigorously corresponds to Leibniz: it’s not the mirror, nor the window, nor the screen. Eh? He will pass by the mirror and the window, and he will reject the window. You see, at the start of the Monadology, we have neither door nor window. Good. Neither mirror, nor… This isn’t adequate. None of the three terms is adequate…. Neither mirror, nor window, nor screen. So then what? And what are we draped with, us, if we can use this terms since we are units ? Can we say “the walls of a unit”? What are these closed, opaque walls? Let’s call them information grids .
The subject is not open onto the exterior. It is in communication with an information grid that corresponds to it, and data are inscribed onto this grid. And on my very own information grid, certain bits of data are inscribed. On the information grid for one of you, other bits of data are inscribed. Is there a world? Yes, there is a world if the information grids align, if there is a concordance of information grids. Where would this concordance come from? That’s something we cannot know at the moment; we won’t even ask ourselves that. We say: I don’t open my window on the outside; I consult an information grid. So there, I consult within myself. I consult an information grid within myself; I don’t open my window. What is this ? It’s the city. Why is that the city? The city is in our heads, you know? The city, this is marvelous, the city; as has been said, it’s a brain, the city. And it’s not only that: a monstrous brain, a disgusting brain, that is, an information grid. Yes.
This is why I believe that it’s not by chance that the phrase “a point of view onto the city” flows from his pen. A point of view onto the countryside, this is the window. But here, I don’t even open my window in the morning. There is no longer any need for windows. There are people without windows. If I want to know the temperature, I have two ways : the countryside way, I open my window and even risk sticking my arm outside; then pulling it back in, I close the window. Fine. But otherwise? Otherwise, I have a dedicated thermometer, with a wire going inside, and another inside, with two readings; and I look at the thermometer, and I know simultaneously the temperature inside the house and the temperature outside. This is already the start of an information grid. Some bits of digital data are inscribed on my information grid. Neither door, nor window. I have a monologue with myself: Ah, wow, it’s cold. But I haven’t opened my window. This is the regime of information grids in the city.
“We are points of view onto the city.” You see what that means now. That means: being a point of view is reading an information grid. Simply, I always have information that the other does not have, fortunately. Each person has his/her own information. All that could create discord. A singular harmony is required for all these kinds of information even to come into a vague concordance. Here too, even at the cost… I am making jumps to try to … Above all, don’t take all this literally; we are in an introduction, so given that, I did not mean that Leibniz is a precursor of Schoenberg, especially not that. I used Schoenberg to make something small understood. I don’t mean to say that Leibniz is the precursor of modern painting, but there is a point that is striking in modern painting, and it has been emphasized – I spoke about it in past years: it’s how the canvas changes status, how the canvas has changed status, that is, how for a long time, the canvas was like or called for a window on the world. In what we call modern painting, I’m not saying this would be better, but sense that there is no longer a window onto the world. Take what’s known as abstract expressionism which has been something fundamental for launching a painting called contemporary. Fine. Is a painting by Pollock a window on the world? And it’s not only the question of figurative or not figurative. It’s not this that… A line by Pollock – I am taking for those who know what that is – a line by Pollock obviously is not a window onto the world. It’s what? It’s inscribed onto an opaque surface, of what type? Say, this interests me because if there is a painting of inflection, and of inflection with variable curvature, it’s indeed a line by Pollock.
But then, in what sense does that develop? That develops more and more in the form of… The line is inscribed onto a kind of information grid, either a temperature curve . The question becomes not “what do I see through the window?”, but “what kinds of information does the painting communicate to me?” The painting has become an opaque surface that functions like an information grid. And perhaps, as an American critic has said, in a very lovely article, the person through which that appears the best, where the genius of painting appears the most profoundly, is Rauschenberg. No doubt, it’s with Rauschenberg that a new status appears. I am not at all saying that he invents it all at once; it’s once again because it was Pollock and all those who preceded Pollock… One would have to create an entire history of this mutation of the painting’s status. But you find yourself before a famous painting by Rauschenberg that shows a line of inflection on the opaque layer that covers the painting. Or sometimes he creates forms from cut-up newspapers. These are not at all collages, understand: he uses printed matter as backing. One can no better underscore the painting as an information grid. And this is how he creates his painting, a kind of infinitely sinuous line, a line of infinite inflection with numerical data, and numerical data in all the senses. An information grid, in fact, no longer knows high or low, right or left. A window, yes, a window has a high and a low, a right and a left. One window refers to a horizontal man; an information grid no longer refers to a horizontal man, that is, there is liberation of the point of view in relation to any frontality. Good, and this painting I am thinking of, the famous one by Rauschenberg, as its line and its numbers, and  from it emanated a pictorial power in a pure state, and leaves us with this question: “What information does this painting convey to me?” So I would say that here, we have something like an approximation of a realized Leibnizian world. 
In what sense? I just wanted to say, there, in what direction we have today fulfilled our short portion, the task we gave ourselves, specifically: the last time – I really want you to sense our progress, how slow it is; you have to sense this – the last time, once again, we had been on the first floor of Baroque architecture, not the lower floor, but the upper floor. We’ve moved from inflection, from curvature to the infinite series. And today, we’ve moved from inflection to inclusion. Inflection included itself, is included in what? Inflection is included in a point of view. On what condition? On the condition that point of view be grasped without reference to a supposed exteriority and only with reference to other points of view, that is, that the model not be the window, but the information grid, as an information grid, a play between terminals, whatever you like. You can act stupidly , you can say whatever since, from the moment that you don’t insist on it, there’s no point doing so. Leibniz’s fundamental statement, to support all this: there is no window. So I believe myself to have answered the question: in what sense can we consider that inflections are included in points, in points defined as points of view?
So go reflect on all this, and tell me about it next time. And then, I stared into the camera, eh! I hope so, I hope that I didn’t ruin it by looking into the camera… So there we are; thank you very much. Tired… The heat… the filmmaking… This was all cinema! You want me to fall? Fine, so long! There we are, it’s recess. That’s it! 
 
Lecture 04, 16 December 1986: Review: Inherence to Inflection, and the Monad and the Individual
So much has happened that we hardly recognize each other. I don’t know really what you remember in what we are doing. Once I’ve said that the student movement must not lose its strength, among the secondary activities, it’s suggested that you should create a petition addressed to the University president to propose the hypothesis: are the bars that have been installed compatible with security? In the event that a fire should break out here, how would we get out? Moreover there is the matter of keys, of locked doors, open not closed, then not open, all this detracts greatly from your intellectual efforts. So a petition is needed, a very polite one. But the security bars, think about this! Ok. In the preceding meetings which were very poorly attended, we talked about what happened, so I don’t think we have to return to this, unless someone has a declaration to make? Let me restate, but it’s obvious for everyone, what really matters is that this student movement should continue, that it not give up. That’s why I think all the students’ efforts are very important, at the level of each university in order even to create the elements of a counter-project for the university organization. The professors could also get a bit involved. Ok.
So let’s continue, amazed already to be at the fourth meeting. Next week vacation begins, from 20 Dec to 6 Jan. And as usual, the sixth is a Tuesday, every time we come back from break it’s Tuesday, so we will meet on Tuesday, 6 Jan. Today I would like to make every effort to finish the first part, with the option of abridging some things, which is not a problem, and I’d like to start with some numbered remarks. And fine, you will see yourselves, I am trying to create short summaries and state some things that I have not yet said in order to bring you back into the focus of our work. My first remark, you recall, is whas this introductory part consists of, and I told you, it’s very simple: Leibniz’s Baroque philosophy unfolds on two floors. What I did not say is that, already in this idea of a world of two floors, there is something that must impress us because that engages philosophical reflection in general. Specifically, does this two-floored Baroque world, which I will not return to, engage all philosophical reflection because, perhaps it is an important moment for a problem that is troubling metaphysics, at that moment, and had been for a long time, notably the famous problem of two worlds, the intelligible world and the sensible world? Doesn’t Baroque philosophy, or more precisely, doesn’t Leibniz, by presenting us with a two-floored world, belong to this tradition all the while revising it quite profoundly? How are these floors distributed? In the history of philosophy, they had already undergone many changes before Leibniz. So we will be interested in knowing in what way the disjunction, the distinction in Leibniz’s works develops a very profound revision of the distinction of two worlds. All the more so since we saw what these floors consisted of, and I told you that the Baroque world is the world of the fold extending to infinity, and that initially is differentiated and doubled into two kinds of fold.
On one floor we have the pleats of matter, and on the other floor the folds in the soul; pleats of matter and folds in the soul. And the floor with pleats of matter is like the world of the composed, of the infinitely composed, matter never ceasing to be refolded and unfolded, and on the other floor, it’s the floor of the Simples . The souls are simple, hence the expression: the folds in the soul, in the soul. Thus we saw a vague program of study of the pleats of matter, and then we started into an analysis of what the folds in the soul mean. 
Second remark. To answer this question of what the folds in the soul are, we set off in search – the two floors have to communicate – in search of an ideal genetic element, an ideal genetic element of the pleats of matter.
In an earlier meeting, we studied the pleats of matter, why matter is a power that never ceases refolding, and then we passed on to the hypothesis of an ideal genetic element of the pleats of matter. And no doubt, if there is such an element of the pleats of matter, what is it? It is the variable curve or the inflection. For Leibniz, the world is fundamentally affected by a curve. We have seen the importance of this, from the viewpoint of the physics of matter, but beyond the physics of matter, in mathematic and in mathematical idealities . The mathematical ideality is a curve, the curve of the universe. This is a very profound Leibnizian theme. You recall that this did not surprise us, to notice that inflection, or the variable curve, goes to infinity. I’ll remind you briefly that we saw this through the very properties of the irrational number, or the “deaf” number as they said in the seventeenth century; the irrational or deaf number is, at once, inseparable from the curve on the straight line, and also engenders – still a genetic element -- an infinite series. So the variable curvature, or the inflection, goes to infinity. The idea of an infinite series would define one the most important chapters of Leibniz’s mathematics. 
Third remark: from the inflection, that is, the variable curvature, from the inflection to the point of view. No doubt, the concept of inflection already had a very great characteristic originality in Leibniz’s philosophy, so grant him as well that the introduction of point of view as a philosophical concept must have had an extreme importance for philosophy. From inflection to point of view: why? Because the variable curvature refers to centers. Centers of curvature, on the side of the concavity of the curve. So the variable curve is inseparable from vectors of concavity. And the center, understood as center of the variable curvature, what is it? It is the vertex, it is the point of view. What does ‘vertex’ mean? It means that it is the locus of points where the tangents meet at each point of the variable curve. You remember? I would say that such a center of the curvature is a point of view on the portion of the curve defined by a vector of concavity. And that is what was essential. I want you to understand, independently of anything very scientific or philosophical, how one passes precisely, how naturally, it’s a kind of deduction that I want to propose to you. How one passes from the idea of inflection or variable curvature to that of point of view.
I tried to show you in what sense this was very important -- and in his book on Leibniz , Michel Serres showed it perfectly -- in what sense it was very, very important that, ultimately, for Leibniz, the substitution occurred from the center conceived as center of configuration of a regular figure, for this notion of center was substituted that of point of view. In the center of the circle is substituted the vertex of the cone, the vertex of the cone is the point of view. So as if through a necessary linkage we pass from the idea of variable curvature to the point of view or vertex. For the geometry of the center is substituted a geometry of vertices, a geometry of points of view. Is that ok? Is it clear?
Fourth remark, but once again, this is valid for all of today’s remarks, these are the steps of a deduction. Recall well, by virtue of the earlier remark, how we have passed from the idea of inflection to that of point of view. That’s what seems fundamental to me. Realize that if we had started by proposing Leibniz’s notion of point of view, one could have said some extremely interesting things, of course, but we would not have understood how we got there. When a philosopher discovers new concepts, it’s not suddenly, all at once, in his head. He got there through all sorts of problems. The universe first had to be affected by a curvature, and more, by a variable curvature. It’s an elastic world; this is Leibniz’s physics of elasticity. The universe had to be affected by a variable curvature so that, afterward, the notion of point of view might really be concretely founded. Consider how we pass from inflection to point of view. The center of the variable curvature is no longer a center, in the sense of center of a circle, that is, the center of a regular configuration; it’s a site, it’s a vertex. It’s a vertex as a function of which I see, that is, it’s something that makes itself visible.
Fourth remark : But what is a point of view? First characteristic, it seems to me, a point of view is always in relation with a variation or a series. Moreover, it is itself empowered to place into a series, the power of arranging , the power of arranging cases. We saw it in the simple mathematical examples, the vertex of the cone is a point of view because it has the power of arranging curves to the second degree. Circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola. The vertex of Pascal’s arithmetic triangle, you remember that lovely triangle? I hope so, but it doesn’t matter… The vertex of Pascal’s arithmetical triangle is the power of arranging the second degree powers. This is the first characteristic of the point of view. 
The second characteristic of point of view: above all, it does not mean everything is relative, or at least it means that everything is relative on condition that the relative becomes absolute. What do I mean? I mean that the point of view does not indicate a relativity of what is seen, that follows from the preceding characteristic: if the point of view is really the power of arranging cases, power of placing phenomena into series, point of view is then, suddenly, the condition for emergence or manifestation of a truth in things. You will find no truth if you do not have a determined point of view. It’s the curvature of things that requires the point of view. One can say nothing else; this curved universe of Leibniz, one has to start there. If not, everything stays abstract. In other words, there is no truth if you have not found a point of view is possible, that is, from which a particular kind of truth is possible.
It’s in this way that the theory of point of view introduces into philosophy what I call a perspectivism. When Nietzsche declared himself close to Leibniz, it’s precisely in the name of such a perspectivism, and in Nietzsche’s as well as Leibniz’s work, perspectivism will not mean to each person a different truth, but will mean point of view as condition for the manifestation of the true. But for another great perspectivist, the novelist Henry James, point of view and the technique of points of view never meant that truth is relative to each person, but that there is a point of view starting from which chaos is organized, in which the secret is discovered. 
Third characteristic of point of view: henceforth, point of view is not at all a frontal perspective that would allow a form to be seized in its best conditions. Point of view is fundamentally Baroque, but why? This is because point of view is never a means through which one can seize a form, but point of view is a means through which one seizes a series of forms: passages from one form to another, or as anamorphosis: passage from chaos to form. This is the very character of Baroque perspective.
Last characteristic of point of view: point of view is affected by a fundamental pluralism; whoever says point of view says plurality of points of view. Point of view is inseparable from a pluralism, indeed, but in which sense? Notice that in this, we are going to have a little difficulty: the point of view is essentially multiple. That all philosophy of point of view is pluralist, we know in any case that, yet again, this certainly does not mean “to each person a different truth”. That’s not right, that’s not what founds the pluralism of point of view. Once again, on the contrary, we saw that it’s the power of arranging and of creating series, of creating series of a multitude of forms. Point of view opens onto an infinite series.
Well yes, but still… This is a bit disturbing. Why? If the point of view opens onto an infinite series, -- that is, let’s say at an extreme, if every point of view is onto an infinite series, that is if every point of view is onto the world – this is not surprising since the world is affected by a curvature, so that point of view is then onto the world – I am trying to speak to you in very ordinary terms about what Leibniz presents in an elaboration of concepts that’s much more. If any point of view is onto the world, why are there several points of view? If point of view is an infinite series, why are there several points of view? Perhaps we are going to have difficulties in accounting . However, we still must maintain: there is an essential plurality of points of view. Perhaps my figure 2 indicates this enough: if the world is in inflection, and point of view is defined on the side of concavity, there is evidently a distribution of points of view around the point of inflection. So there are necessarily several points of view. I am sure of two things. As a result of this brief remark, I am certain that any point of view opens onto an infinite series, and at an extreme, onto the series of series, that is, onto the world; and I am certain also that there are several points of view. The little difficulty is, yet again, that by virtue of the first characteristic, point of view opens onto the infinite series, that is, onto the world. Why is there not a single point of view that it would simply be necessary to discover and to rise to? Well no, there are necessarily several points of view because of the curvature, the inflection, the variable curvature. We will have to arrange that. One senses that there is something needing to be arranged. Still, though, an essential pluralism remains the final noteworthy characteristic, for the moment, of point of view.
This was my fourth remark. This fourth remark provided elements for defining what one must understand by Baroque perspective. As a result of these four initial remarks, I say we have passed from the variable curvature, or inflection, to point of view.
Fifth remark. We are going to pass from point of view to inclusion or inherence, a constant word for Leibniz, in esse in Latin. What is this in esse? It’s “being in”, being included in. It was not enough to go from the variable curvature or inflection to point of view; we have to go from point of view to inclusion and inherence. This is the object of the fifth remark. -- Come in… and please close the door -- So that our total object is to show how we necessarily pass from the variable curvature or inflection to inclusion or inherence. For the moment, my fifth remark is: how do we pass from point of view to inclusion? I told you that Leibniz often adopts the following theme: you can always construct a right angle in a circle. This is not the center of the circle, it’s the vertex; in the Leibnizian technique of translation of centers into vertices, it’s the vertex of a right angle. Where does the right angle begin? The closer you get to the circle arc of the vertex itself, the more you notice that the angle is already a right angle. At most, the fact that this angle is a right angle is included in S, I included in the vertex, is included in the point of view. You will tell me that, still, this is a bit weak, but that’s what I’m looking for, things that really go without saying. In a certain way, the angle is already right in the point S such as it is defined? Good.
Or, I would say: the variable curvature is in the curvature center that corresponds to it . Why? Precisely since this center precisely is the locus of points where the tangents meet at each point of the variable curvature This is a strange idea; so now this is what must be said: the visibility, or if you prefer that which is manifest, the phenomenon. Or if you prefer, the curve. The visible curve is located in point of view onto the curve. The visible curve is as if in the center of the curvature, the visible curve is located in the point of view onto the curve. Good.
Reading philosophy means doing two things at once: it means being very attentive to the linkage of concepts, that’s what philosophical reading is; but there is no philosophical reading without there being a non-philosophical reading. And the non-philosophical reading, without which the philosophical reading remains dead, provides all kinds of sensible intuitions that you must emerge within you, but extremely rudimentary sensible intuitions, and because of this, are extremely lively.
The visible is included in point of view. What does that mean? If we try to continue from this, what sensible intuition is located underneath this, let’s begin again with our variable curvature. Our variable curvature is the fold, or the genetic element of the fold. We saw that matter ceaselessly folds back onto itself, more generally the world is folded. Let me ask why something is folded? Why is it folded? This comes back to Leibniz, he is famous for asking a reason for each thing; it’s a philosophy that he himself presents as a philosophy of sufficient reason. Everything has a reason. What he understands by reason, we will see, but we cannot start from there, it’s too abstract. Not that it’s too difficult, but just that at this point, it would make Leibniz die. We’d have a kind of death of Leibniz. You can only make a philosopher live through the non-philosophical reading that you undertake. Such that the most philosophical of all philosophers, is in some ways the least philosophical of all philosophers, and in the history of philosophy, there was the most philosophical of philosophers who was also the least philosophical of philosophers, that is, accessible to non-philosophers, that’s Spinoza. We’re out of luck, we are talking about Leibniz, and here comes Spinoza: the author that would be susceptible to an extremely complex philosophical reading, and at the same time, the most violent non-philosophical reading. Before it was ever Nietzsche, it was Spinoza. But let’s say it was also Leibniz.
So why would something be folded? At the level of non-philosophical sensible intuition, I am saying something very simple. I was saying in the last class, before we left each other for such a long time , I don’t know if things are folded. Leibniz says yes, the universe is affected by a curvature, but why? Why is it useful to be folded? Why is being pleated useful? If things are folded, it’s in order to be placed inside. That’s an answer at least. -- Ahh, this is the petition for the president that I will read to you later. -- I was telling you, well yes, things are folded only to be enveloped. Things are folded in order to be included, to be placed inside. This is very curious. That is, the fold – here we have some non-philosophy -- refers to the envelope. The fold/folded thing is what you place in the envelope, in other words: the envelope is the reason for the fold. You would not fold if it weren’t for placing in an envelope. The envelope is the final cause of the fold.
I’m translating into philosophical concepts. Inclusion is the reason for inflection. Inflection is the reason for curvature. Things had to be folded in order to be placed inside. We have not finished our reflection. What is folded – I am going very slowly because I want you to understand as we proceed – what is folded, or if you prefer, what is curved, since inflection appeared as the genetic element of the fold, what is folded, or inflected, or curved by a variable curvature, through this enveloped in something. So here’s the first thing that I would like you to grant me. So if you ask me, why, well, just stop, stop asking why. But stop, stop to ask why. One mustn’t ask why; one must ask, “is that ok?”  It’s Leibniz’s world. 
So, fine. What is folded is necessarily enveloped in something; otherwise it would not be folded. What is folded is only folded, what is curve is only curve to be enveloped. To envelop, in Latin, is involvere or implicare. Implicated, enveloped, is the same thing. Implicare, what is that? It is the state of the fold that is enveloped in something, that is implicated in something. There’s great beauty in all that, as beautiful as a work of art. And in relation to a work of art, it has an advantage which is that, in fact, it’s true. It is true that things happen like that.
Let’s continue. If you’ve understood me to this point, I’m beginning…  What’s folded, plicare, also means implicare, what is folded is placed inside something, is included in something. What’s folded is folded only in order to be within something. In other word, therefore, a little step forward: what is folded does not exist outside that which includes it, what implies it, what envelops it. What is folded does not exist outside that which envelops it. Let’s continue step by step. What is folded does not let itself be unfolded except ideally. Unfolding what is folded is possible, but it’s an operation of abstraction. What is folded exists only as enveloped within something. If you develop this something, it’s possible, but it’s an abstraction. You make an abstraction, at that moment, from the envelope. In other terms, what is folded exists only in its enveloper . But then, what progress have we made? This progress is complicated in the fifth remark.
I would say, in this fifth remark, we can conclude: what is folded not only refers to a point of view, -- this was the object of the preceding remarks, -- what is folded refers to a point of view, but – my fifth remark -- what is folded does not refer only to a point of view, but is necessarily enveloped in something that occupies the point of view. There we have not finished assessing the progress we’ve made. What is folded refers to a point of view, but moreover, is necessarily implicated, is necessarily enveloped, implicated within something that occupies the point of view. We have not finished assessing these little bits of progress since you certainly sense that when we said earlier “the visible is included, enveloped in the point of view,” it was an approximation; that did not entirely work, that it was by approximation that I can say the right angle is in the vertex. But also I am no longer saying that; it was a way of speaking, we had no other at that moment. Now we can, in fact, specify a bit: by saying that it was almost that , but not quite that. For what is folded is not enveloped in the point of view; what is curved or folded, is enveloped within in a something that occupies this point of view, but henceforth there is something that occupies the point of view, and that is what we have not discussed. 
And this something that occupies the point of view, henceforth, you will grant Leibniz that at once he can tell us, by commodity and to go more quickly, he can identify it with point of view itself, and likewise distinguish it, on the contrary, from the point of view. Thus I conclude this fifth remark by saying that we find ourselves now faced with two propositions that have a relation of progression with each other. First proposition: what is folded necessarily refers to a point of view since inflection, or variable curvature, refers to a point of view. Second proposition, what is folded is necessarily enveloped within something that occupies the point of view.
The sixth remark would have for object to specify what this progression consists of. Up to there, ok? No problems? I’d really like that you take from this, if that suits you, a method for your reading. I insist on that, on this necessity. What I am in the process of doing is nearly an operation for de-philosophizing. I really think that the only completely philosophical reading occurs if you make it coexist with a non-philosophical reading. That’s why philosophy is not at all something for specialists; it’s both something for specialists, and at the same time absolutely a non-specialist thing. Both need to be maintained at the same time. A good philosophy is eminently a specialist thing since it consists in creating concepts, but it’s fundamentally a non-specialist thing because concepts are truly sketches, sketches of sensible intuitions.
So I would like to insist on… Here’s a new example. Inflection was overtaken by the idea of point of view, and now the idea of point of view is overcome by a something that occupies the point of view. I would say of this something that it’s something enveloping, something implicating. The fold is implicated in the implicating. We know in advance that this enveloping is, in general, the subject. The subject, or according to Whitehead’s words -- if we jump from one reading to another, it’s indeed the first time that a philosopher defines the subject in that way as a point of view, a vertex, a superject. 
That’s really curious: the subject is what comes to a point of view. And I say that, on one hand, Leibniz will act as if subject and point of view are the same thing, and likewise he will be very formal, very precise, and he will tell us that point of view is the modality of the subject, that one cannot say any better that the subject must be defined independently of point of view, it comes to a point of view, the point of view is its inseparable mode, but it’s not the point of view that defines the subject. I get the impression there that Leibniz’s commentators really don’t see clearly this progression and are quite satisfied with the notion of point of view in order to define the subject. And this is not possible. The subject really must… Why? Because the subject is not point of view, it’s enveloping. So it has a point of view; of course, it has a point of view, but to speak in a learned way, in its constitution it is not point of view. Resulting from its constitution is that a subject comes to a point of view and is inseparable from a point of view, but the point of view is not its very constitution. 
In other words, what is our progression? First I say that point of view is a point of view onto an infinite series, that is, the point of view is a point of view onto the constituted series, the infinite series constituted by the states of the world. That’s what point of view is. It bears on the infinite series of the states of the world. You see that in my first floor, my first floor above matter, is perhaps sketched something like different little floors. I’d say that if I limited myself to point of view, I remain in a scale of perception; it’s the world of the percept. The point of view looks onto the infinite series in the states of the world. It’s like the manifestation of visibility, it’s the percept. But moreover, I say: the world, the series of the world, the infinite series of the world is enveloped in something that comes to the point of view, that is, is enveloped in the subject.
At that point, notice that the status of the world has changed, no longer exactly as earlier the infinite series of the states of the world because what is enveloped in the subject is what? By nature, it’s what we call the predicate, or if you prefer, the attribute. The infinite series of states of the world has now become the infinite series of predicates of the subject, infinite series of predicates of a subject that envelops them. We have passed from the infinite series of states to the infinite series of predicates or attributes. Indeed, if the infinite series of states of the world is in the subject, is enveloped in the subject, the states of the world are also the predicates of the subject, the attributes of the subject. All of that involves a lot of things, but we won’t bother with that yet; notably, we won’t bother yet with the formidable and beautiful question: what is an attribute of the subject?!
I will simply say: well ok, if the states of the world are enveloped in the subject, the states of the world must necessarily be the predicates of the subject that envelops them. You see again the tiny progress: we are no longer in the domain of visibility. So what domain are we in? We have passed from visibility to legibility . We have passed from visibility to legibility. From a certain point of view, I see the world, but within me, I read it. Hence this very charming text by Leibniz, Monadology, paragraph 36… no, not that, it’s paragraph 61, I’ll read it to you:
“A soul” – that is, a subject -- “can read in itself only what is distinctly represented.” It matters little what that means, the text. We are not yet able to provide commentary on it, but we can note that Leibniz does not say and will never say – well, don’t ever say “never”, one has to be careful -- when he is speaking rigorously, he will never say – although he occasionally speaks less rigorously to go faster – he will never say that the soul sees into itself; he will say that the soul reads into itself. What it envelops are states of the world as predicates of the subject.  And the soul reads its own predicates at that same time that under the point of view where it is located, it sees the states of the world. That gets complicated, but it was worth the effort because we are, in fact, no longer in the domain of the percept at the level of the envelopment. At the level of the point of view, we are in the percept, but on the level of the subject-predicate envelopment, we are in the concept. We are in the concept. With one qualification, which is evidently fundamental: on the condition of conceiving the concept as individual. The subject is individual. Why? Precisely because it does not exist without coming to a point of view. In other words, what is a subject? It’s a concept, it’s a notion, and each time that Leibniz says “subject,” you should correct him by substituting “notion”, it’s the notion of the subject, in Leibniz, always. And what is a notion of subject? It’s an individual notion, he says. In other words, the concept extends all the way to the individual. Moreover, the individual is the concept, it’s the notion. This is strange; there we are still absolutely incapable of understanding. But it’s interesting to note what will need to be understood for the future. I can say that Leibniz is without doubt the ancient philosopher, or relatively ancient, who was the most modern from the point of view of logic.
If we ask Leibniz what a subject is, he will answer that it’s what is indicated by a proper noun. You know the extent to which, in modern logic since Russell, the theory of proper noun has had importance. We will see it in detail later. Leibniz is the first to tell us that the real name of an individual substance, the true name of the subject, is a proper noun. And it’s without doubt with Leibniz that a true logic of proper nouns begins.  What is a subject? It’s Caesar, Adam, you, me. Immediately one steps back, saying, no, it’s the individual notion of each of us because only the individual notion encompasses predicates. What are the predicates that we encompass? All the states of the world! In other words, what comes to a point of view? What comes to a point of view is the subject understood as an individual notion. What comes to a point of view is what is indicated by a proper noun. I see from a point of view and I read in the subject. Seeing and reading. Percept and concept. 
In other words, summarizing this remark rapidly – this was my focus throughout this entire introduction and in all of the preceding meetings -- we have indeed passed from inflection to inherence. But at what price? At the price of discovering that not only does inflection refer to point of view, but that point of view refers to something that came to occupy this point of view; the something that occupies this point of view, let us call it: a soul. It’s a soul; a substance, that’s a substance; a superject if we speak like Whitehead and not like Leibniz, since the word is Whitehead’s; an individual notion, a proper noun. 
There is a huge difficulty that we dropped completely; don’t be surprised not to understand what is currently incomprehensible: what precisely is a predicate or attribute, of this substance or subject? We just saw that to the extent that there is envelopment, the states of the world became predicates of the individual subject. There is no subject except as individual, and that is something completely strange in philosophy. Because before the others, what had been debated in the question of knowing in what sense the soul was individual, not individual, what were the consequences of all this ? Leibniz arrives calmly and tells us: every subject is individual, and moreover, the concept extends to the individual and exists only by going to the individual. 
None of that goes without saying, but these are difficulties to be resolved later. We are not quite ready to resolve them now. So we proceed to the extent that we are able to resolve, hence my seventh remark. I am taking a short break; was the sixth remark clear? You just have to grasp the necessity of passing from point of view to inherence, that is, to inclusion, that is, to the idea of something individual that comes to occupy the point of view and that, henceforth, encompasses, envelops the infinite series. I sense that you have understood quite well since you are indicating nothing; you have inscrutable faces. Leibniz would say that in your souls -- and we see clearly the difference between point of view and soul -- in your soul where you read perfectly, at first glance, you see nothing at all… in your soul. In the end, the soul is essential. Fine.
Seventh remark, from which, at least, we must know what we are able to understand. We saw what we were not yet able to comprehend, but in the seventh remark, there is a whole series of texts by Leibniz that are found all over, and that now no longer pose a problem for us. First, and we saw this in the previous meeting, the mirror theme: each subject is a mirror of the world. That really is the language of visibility. Moreover, Leibniz adds, each subject is mirror of the world from its point of view. You see that he does not confuse subject with point of view, that is, the subject “mirror of the world” through the mode of its point of view, from the point of view it comes to occupy. We were just insisting that one must understand mirror as a concave mirror. Everything that precedes justifies this, that introduction or adjunction of concavity. 
Second point: it’s only a metaphor, and we must get beyond this metaphor. Why get beyond it? Because it settles into the point of view, that is, it sits in the middle of the road. We mustn’t say that each subject is a mirror on the world, because that would seem to suggest that the world exists in itself. Yet, recall that it exists only as folded, that is, it exists only as enclosed in each soul, it exists only as enveloped in each soul or object. Henceforth one must say that, as I was suggesting the last time, rather than a mirror on the world, the subject is a screen on which a film is shown. But as we have noticed, that was still insufficient, since a film has been made and refers to an exteriority, even assumed. From which we invoked rather an opaque table, an opaque table of information where data is registered, without reference to any exteriority. 
The world is enveloped in each subject and exists only as enveloped in each subject. This is the sense in which the Monadology will tell us: subjects, individual substances are “with neither door nor window.” They receive nothing from outside. You see why they receive nothing from outside since everything they have, everything they read or everything that happens to them, they envelop it, they include it. In other words, the world does not exist outside of subjects that include it, the world does not exist outside subjects that envelop it. And nearly as a symbol of Leibniz, I proposed to you the last time a famous painting by Rauschenberg, where everything we need is located, that is, the surface of the painting as an information surface, as a table of information that one must imagine being slightly concave and a ciphered variable curve is inscribed on it. In fact, this is the representation of a Leibnizian world. You see that we have passed onward, causing us only to start over another level that we just completed.  In this seventh remark, we have passed from texts by Leibniz in which he told us that the subject, the individual substance is mirror on the world, to the other kind of deeper text: the individual subject envelops the world; the world does not exist outside subjects that it envelops. Outside subjects that envelop it, that moves us forward again.
Eighth remark. For now the time has come to resolve a difficulty: why several points of view, why several subjects? Why wouldn’t there simply be a single subject that would come to a point of view, and whose point of view would be and would carry onto the infinite series of states of the world, and would thus envelop the totality of predicates; and would have for attribute a term: the infinite series of states of the world; a single subject that would be God? In a certain way, this would be Spinoza, a single substance, God, that encompasses, that contains, that includes all modifications, that includes all constitutive modifications of the world, the infinite series of constitutive modifications of the world. This is just to indicate the extent to which Leibniz insists on the plurality of subjects and on the plurality of points of view. In fact, we go from one to the other, from the plurality of points of view to the plurality of subjects.
But yet again, if it is true that a point of view grasps hold of the infinite series of the world, or if it is true that the subject includes the world, envelops the world -- it’s strange! -- Why several points of view? I remind you that in our previous meeting, I tried to propose an answer to you, which is: the infinite series is essentially susceptible to an infinity of variations. The variations of a series, we’ll have to come back to them, the variations of a series. I was telling you we have to conceive of them in every manner: rhythmic variations, melodic variations, opposite movements, when the ascendant becomes the descendant and vice versa, retrograde movements when you begin at the ending and you obtain another series. So there is an infinity of variations of the infinite series.
So what must we say, that each subject responds to a variation? Without doubt, notably there are not two subjects that begin the infinite series with the same term, nor that end it the same way. That’s why there is necessarily an infinity of subjects. But then there is also a reason, which is: ok, each subject envelops the infinite series, the infinite series of the world, but each subject is defined by a region of this series, the region that it can clearly and distinctly read. I express the world, or if you prefer, I envelop it, I express the world in the manner of a mirror, and I envelop it in the manner of a subject. And then you as well -- there is no reason -- we all express the world. Well, fine, only that we do not clearly express the same portion. Each subject has a finite capacity for clearly reading, the rest is what? We must say that each subject is, literally, dyslexic, for the entire series. You see who this great reader is. The great reader of the world is God. But we, individual subjects: you’ll tell me: but God is an individual as well; sure, God’s an individual, but that is going to cause us problems, the sense in which it’s an individual, and the sense in which we too are individuals, but we haven’t gotten there yet. God envelops the whole series of the world clearly and distinctly, but us? It’s already pretty great, we have a little portion of reading clearly and distinctly, the rest we blabber. We envelop the entire world, but confusedly, obscurely, illegibly. And we have our little portion, our little clear and distinct glimmer, our little glimmer on the world, our little world region: my very own room. That’s already not so bad, my own room! We shouldn’t ask for much more. I express the entire world, I envelop the entire world, but I only clearly envelop a small portion.
What distinguishes me from you, you from me? It’s that we don’t clearly express the same little portion. You’ll say: we have a common sphere, so that’s how we belong, for example, to a same time, that we are co-living. You understand, each of us has his/her common portion, but it can overlap the neighboring one; for example, when we meet in this location with security bars, we clearly express a little portion of space. But if we disperse, each of us again finds his/her own room. We can come together, we can separate, like an accordion. But in every case, our portion of clear envelopment, of legible envelopment, is extremely limited.
So there are necessarily several points of view, or if you prefer, there are necessarily several individual substances. Now I have my answer because, even if it’s true that each individual substance envelops the entire world, it can only read clearly a portion of the world, which is necessarily distinguished from the legible portion of the world, the other. And at the same time, that is not adequate because there we are going to find ourselves facing an impossible problem. We have to manage as best we can. That this is a great problem for Leibniz, that’s what always fascinated him: individuation. That’s his problem. Fortunately we still have a little dissertation he wrote, the exact title written in Latin, since they wrote in Latin at that period in the university; the title is Dissertation on the individual principle, he was 17 or 18 years old. So it’s the equivalent of a …  -- They were more precocious back then. -- It’s a little DEA , it’s a little essay, and it’s not by chance that from the start, this was his problem. So he grasps onto it, and it’s a very interesting discussion relating to certain philosophies of the Middle Ages, with Aristotle, but especially Saint Thomas and Duns Scotus, and that indicates something that remains his focus in all his philosophy all the way to old age. Fine.
We are going to find ourselves in an impossible situation because, you see, what constitutes individuation for Leibniz? First answer which comes to mind: point of view. In fact, in the notion of point of view, he offered a sufficient consistency such that this might be a possible answer. It’s completely new, defining individuation by point of view. There had to be means for doing so; one had to pass through this entire theory of inflexion, of curves. Answer: that could be said, but it’s not the final word because, strictly speaking, point of view cannot define individuation; point of view cannot define the individual since point of view is only the modality of the individual. It’s only the mode of the individual. So, a second answer: let us assume that each individual envelops the entire world, but understand that one only envelops clearly and distinctly a reduced portion of the world.  So it’s this reduced portion that would explain the individual, specifically two individuals do not have the same clear and distinct portion. But that doesn’t work either. You sense that it’s obviously because the individual is individual that it has a portion of the world. I cannot define the individual by the portion of world that it expresses. On the contrary, it’s because it is an individual that it only has a limited portion. That doesn’t work. So, what defines the individuality of the individual? How does one define individuation? We already have two possible answers, possible but not satisfying. Fine.
So, let’s continue: the entire world is enveloped in each subject, the subject is the individual, it is individual substance or the individual notion, it’s the concept proceeding all the way into the individual. It’s the individual notion, it’s what deserves a proper name; the subject is what deserves a proper name. Listen, it’s a strange tale, this logic of proper names, a strange tale because, imagine it: however little you might know, at what point does that breaks with all philosophy, at what does point it delivers something new? You imagine Plato having… No, that presumes that you know Plato, Plato is Ideas. It occurred to Plato to ask: are there ideas of individuals? Is there an idea of Socrates, an idea of Alcibiades? All that. But he encounters problems… Whereas Leibniz arrives and tells us that the notion is individual, that the concept goes all the way into the individual. Why can he say that? We have to put this aside because we have to answer, to answer urgently, to answer today. Perhaps. I hope we’ll have time, but we have to answer it today. Why ?
It’s quite extraordinary. We were thinking about Descartes. All Cartesians never stop reflecting on the I” in Descartes, “I think”. What is this “I”? There is a very interesting thesis written on the notion of the individual notion in Descartes, but it’s an extremely difficult subject because one has to research deeply into his texts. Is the “I” of “I think” an individual subject? No, it’s difficult, we cannot say that it might be indicated by a proper name. “I think” is not: me, Descartes, I am thinking! That’s what Leibniz tells us: “subject” can only have one meaning: what has a proper name. Caesar, Augustus, you, me. The subject is individual.
So I’ll start over. Each world is enveloped in each subject; we have seen how subjects were supposed to be distinguished, by this little portion. Notice that we already have two answers: by the variation of the series, or by the little portion. I am saying that it’s the same thing in the long run because, as the clear and distinct little portion enveloped in each subject varies according to the subject, it’s a variation of the infinite series. Hence, the two answers work well, but they work well by us understanding in them what seems to be their insufficiency. If I say that the world exists enveloped in each subject, well fine, it exists enveloped in each subject. That happens, just as I was saying earlier, we are going to rediscover it exists enveloped in each subject. It exists only as enveloped in each subject. The world does not exist outside the subject that envelops it, the world does not exist outside the subject that implicate it, that include it. Might we say that this is idealism? Given we have to say something… the world does not exist outside the subjects that implicate it. It’s going to be very difficult to say even that it is idealism, one has to be wary. Why? 
Fortunately there is an irreducible plurality of subjects. What do I mean? I mean, look at the transformation of problems that Leibniz imposes on us, I’d say on two levels: in the relations that I might call relations of perception, visible-point of view relations substituting the relations of points of view among themselves, or, what is really the same, in the world-subject relation, substituting the relation of subject between themselves. The world does not exist independently of subjects that envelop it, the world exists only as enveloped in subjects. Yes. But then the fundamental problem becomes: what is the relation of subjects between themselves since objectivity and reality of the world are strictly muddled in the relation of subjects between themselves. 
Is everything ok? I’d almost prefer that here we take a small break if… You see, what I have left is a ninth remark that I’d like you to reflect on during a short break. My ninth remark: finally the moment has arrived, we have to call it, like in English novels when there are chapter titles, How it happened that Leibniz speaks to us about the notion of Monad. How does the monad, the typically Leibnizian notion of Monad, develop from all this? This is why the term monad, up to now, is something I could not pronounce. Take a break, but please, come back. Let’s come back at … 
Let’s make clear this passage from inflexion to inherence. Is there a question? Any problems? : … He says the world only exists insofar as it is enveloped in subject, not because of, eh?
 
Deleuze: Doesn’t being ignorant imply, if I understand correctly, something that is outside the subject, since the subject ignores it? Leibniz’s answer -- that we cannot yet evaluate because we will spend several classes on this -- is that there is no ignorance; there are only degrees of awareness , there are degrees of awareness scaled to infinity. And, in fact, your comment is very good: if for Leibniz there were ignorance, we would have to say that there is something in the world that escapes the subject, that is not enveloped in the subject. But for him, there is no ignorance; there are only degrees of awareness more or less clear, more or less obscure, more or less confused, etc., that is, either it is clear and one knows or it is something like – as it’s frequently said – rumbling . When you say, I don’t know, it’s still a rumbling, it’s in the state of a wave breaking, a cosmic wave breaking in the depths of each of us. So perhaps all subjects communicate through this cosmic breaking wave, but it is not itself outside subjects. But your comment is quite right. Leibniz could not get by if he did not elaborate a theory that isn’t a theory of conscience/awareness, but a theory of an infinity of degrees of awareness.
 
Gilles: It’s indeed a matter of an infinite multiplicity. There is no opposition between multiplicity and infinity. For Leibniz, infinity is the necessary status of the multiple, the multiple goes to infinity. No problem there. All the more so since, for Leibniz, there is no finite multiplicity. There is only infinity in Leibniz. But here as well, that brings up things that we have not yet considered or discussed, that we will have to see later.  
Question: I don’t understand the difference between an individual notion and the concept that goes all the way to the individual.
Deleuze: No difference at all, these are two equivalent expressions. I’ve been saying that I accumulate, I sometimes multiply expressions because it seems to me that some among you can understand one but not the other, so best to add quite a few. I am trying to explain Leibniz to you. I am exactly in the situation of a blind person trying to tap into the clear area of each of you. But the clear area of everyone is very different according to what? This explains everything: according to your own background . Those of you who have read some of Leibniz have a clear area – this isn’t meant to annoy the others – a greater clear area than those who have read nothing at all. And yet, to the extent that all subjects are in each subject, Leibniz really has to be part of you, even if you have read nothing, part of you in the state of rumbling . You have heard that Leibniz said something about a monad. He employed the term “monad”. So you could be reduced to this miniscule part, and then there are some of you who have read Leibniz, and so they have a greater portion. But sometimes I cannot complete this if … What I’d like is not at all that… It’s just that each of you, your personal task is: to capture some Leibniz in your clear area, to the point that… Why would there be progress through Leibniz? Why is he one of the first philosophers who advance the notion of progress? It’s because each individual substance has a power, alas, rather restrained, of enlarging its clear area. That’s what it means to learn; it’s to increase step by step along the scale of degrees of consciousness. So fine, we have come to the ninth remark… 
Question : How do you understand the following thing as regards Leibniz: he both affirms the subject as individual substance, the subsistence of individual receives nothing from the exterior, and yet he defines the individual subject by the proper name which, in fact, implies receiving something from the exterior?
Deleuze: Ha, let’s see. I say that one has to distinguish – here I am inventing nothing because I can recall the texts, it’s great – one has to distinguish the nominal proper name, which is the name of convention. Whereas Caesar is called Caesar, and Augustus is called Augustus, and each of you is called what you are called, that’s a conventional operation which, to some extent, can be said to come from the exterior, but without at all affecting the subject, according to Leibniz. Moreover, he has a text in New Essays on Human Understanding, a little chapter devoted to proper names where he says: proper names derive from common names, these are names of kind and genre. For example, you are called “laborer,” it’s an example, someone with the name “laborer.” This means that he doesn’t believe in proper names in this sense. When I say: the proper name indicates the individual substance; it is something that the conventional proper name symbolizes, but only manages to symbolize. The proper name means: what is subject is an infinite aggregation of propositions. For example, I say: x has crossed the Rubicon, has been assassinated by his son or step-son, I don’t know. There the individual subject, I can say, is designated by a proper name that is his internal determination. So if you say to me: what is the proper name of Caesar, I answer: it’s the internal determination of Caesar. We will say that by convention the internal determination of Caesar, that aspect through which it is an enveloper , this internal determination is conventionally designated by the proper name “Caesar.” It’s a common name applied to an individual substance.
So, the ninth remark. We will have done a lot today. Where does the “monad” come from, a strange name? And in fact, the monad, you can’t do better since you open Mondalogy and the first word there, after the title, in paragraph one: “The monad, about which we will speak here is nothing other than a simple substance.” That sounds really bizarre, monad, to the point that, for us, each time we hear the word “monad”, we add, “as Leibniz said.” And where does that come from? Let’s note that he uses it rather late. Specialists locate the word’s first use in 1697, so there was an entire part of Leibniz’s work in place, in which he spoke about individual substance, soul, individual notion, and not a word about monad”. That must have really pleased him, but he didn’t invent the word. The word “monad” was in consistent and systematic philosophical usage in the works of some very interesting authors that were neo-Platonists. The Greek word monas yields monad, because the declension is in “d” , the Monas. If one looks hard – I am saying things that I am not entirely sure about because this is from research that I did not do and I don’t have the necessary dictionaries. The word is found in Plotinus. 
But in what sense? In the sense of unity. Not just any sense of unity, but in a variable sense of unity. I can say, I think, that neither Plato nor even Plotinus, who is the founder of neo-Platonism, made systematic use of the word. On the other hand, systematic use occurs among the neo-Platonists, that is, the disciples of Plotinus, among whom the first great one is Proclus. Monos means “a single” , one all alone. One sees this in reading a very short book by Proclus, notably Elements of Theology, where one sees that monas designates something very particular because monas is unity, but there is another term. Monas is unity, but the One . The en in Greek is not stated as monos, but as En, E and n, the En. And there is a Greek substantive derived from En which is Henas, that we translate as Hénade. So it’s curious, you see: monad, hénade, monas, henas, what is that? Either that means nothing, and is useless, or monad indicates a very special type of unity, which is going to unfold, and that will receive status in neo-Platonism, an increasingly rigorous status starting with Proclus. So that’s what I think we need to know.
We need to know a little bit more about this: what is this particular sense of unity? Proclus tells us a lot about a certain stage of the One. You know that if we had to define it, neo-Platonism is a philosophy building as a fundamental category the One and the Multiple. That’s its business. Starting with Plato, there are two great directions: Aristotelianism that draws the couple form-matter from Plato, and neo-Platonism that draws forth the couple One-multiple starting with Plotinus. The Aristotelian tradition will consider components of form and matter which will yield solid figures. Plotinism, or neo-Platonism, will consider components of One and multiple that will yield figures of light. If there is a figure in Plotinus, it’s that of light. He is the great philosopher of light. Before things, there was light, and light emanates from the One, from the En. Parenthetically, but here I am getting too learned, in the Pythagorean tradition, Monas is fire. You might wonder why I am saying that. Because in Proclus we indeed see that Monas does not designate just any kind of unity. Generally speaking, Monas is reserved for two special characteristics. It designates a stage of the One that is already massive in virtual multiplicity. And in fact, neo-Platonism will consist of a series of floors where, on the final floor, way on top, there is the One or Light, the One above all else, the One about which one can say nothing. The One more than Being. The One that is truly one, about which one cannot even say it Is, the One above Being, and above all else. 
And starting from this One, in which form -- there we have the philosophy of Plotinus, not our object of study this year -- I won’t even say flows from it, but trickles from it like light, like light rays, streams from it light rays where we can locate digressive stages of the One. And one of the stages of the One is when the One ceases being purely One in order to envelop, to implicate – involvere say the Latin translations – to envelop some multiple, and this enveloped multiple is of the virtual multiple, not yet passed into act, huge unities of a virtual multiplicity. And under the Monas, just like above the Monas there is the One, the One that is only One, the One without multiplicity, the purely One One; below the Monas, there is a one that is nothing other than an arithmetic element, a numerical element in a multiplicity that has passed into act, in an actual multiplicity. That’s the numerical unity.
So there we have the first characteristic, very approximately, because Proclus is rather awfully complicated. In brief summary, I say: monas designates first of all unity, when unity is full of a virtual multiplicity. In second place: monas designates unity when it is the principle of a digressive series . For example, in the text Elements of Theology, I read: “The monad, serving the function of principle, engenders the multiplicity which is appropriated to it. This is why each series -- neo-Platonists are the first to create a philosophy of series -- is one, and each order is One.” In the Greek text, it’s En. You see: that monad, serving the function of principle, engenders the multiplicity which is appropriated to it; it’s why each series is one and each order is one. From one end to the other, it receives from its monad its descent toward the multiplicity, for it is neither of order nor of series if the monad remains in itself infertile. In other words, la monas is unity as principle of a digressive series. Example: from the pure soul flows the souls of the Gods, and even the souls of the Gods themselves form an entire series. There the neo-Platonists surpassed themselves because there is the Jupiteic soul , the dried out soul , the titanic soul, the souls, the souls, the souls, the souls. The procession of souls is sublime, but this hardly matters. From the pure soul flow the souls of the Gods. From the souls of the Gods flow the souls of men, from the souls of men – which are reasonable souls – in certain cases flow the souls of animals, etc. etc. … You have a digressive series. The principle of this series will be called Monas.
Similarly, if you make a series of the Enas, a series of the Ones, of unities, you place on top: the One more than Being, then the One which encompasses, which envelops a potential multiplicity, then the One that is nothing other than a unity in an actual multiplicity, you have a series. You will say that there is a Monas as principle of the series of Enades. You see that all this is really beautiful. So I say, to stay with Proclus and neo-Platonism, the Monas designates the unity, but under two conditions, that the unity be full, thick with a virtual multiplicity that it envelops. Second condition: that it be the principle of a digressive series that flows from it. I don’t need to return to what we did in order to say that these two traits suit Leibniz marvelously.
Question: What is the reference in Proclus?
Deleuze: In Proclus? Ah, paragraph 21. But at the same time, there’s a constant. Monade is constantly present there. But on the other hand, Proclus is… Among the rare things that we still retain from Proclus, there is an admirable commentary on Parmenides where his thought is much more developed. That’s quite evidently a summary of lessons. But in the commentary on Plato’s Parmenides by Proclus, there is an entire theory of the monad, quite lovely.
You see what suited Leibniz. I would be astounded if he knew this word very late; he knew it the entire time, but it must have been in a kind of inspiration, he told himself suddenly: My God! Why haven’t I been using this word? It’s exactly what I need. And at the same time, he is going to transplant it entirely, for he will indeed retain its two traits: the monad is a unity as principle of series, and a unity as filled with a virtual multiplicity. As we say, filled with a virtual multiplicity since from his viewpoint, it is the opening onto an infinite series. So this suits us perfectly, but it still would be quite properly grotesque to say that Leibniz yielded to a neo-Platonic influence, since it is entirely true that Leibniz succumbed to neo-Platonic influence, but on entirely other points than this one, because by using the word “monad”, he gives to it a situation, another completely original function that neo-Platonists knew strictly nothing at all. And if you will, if I were to sum up, Leibniz tells us what would be monstrous and incomprehensible for a neo-Platonist: the monad the individual notion, the individual itself, the individual taken in its notion; or, if you prefer, it’s subjective unity, it is subjectivity, it’s the subject. Which amounts to saying: unity as monad, is the individual. 
And how did he get to the point of saying that? We have to see that there are two strictly linked points in Leibniz, which neo-Platonism does not grasp. These are the infinite and the individual. Why are these two points linked? Because Leibniz tells us, the individual envelops the infinite. You will find this text in New Essays on Human Understanding. I have to give you the paragraph reference so that you can read it yourself, but it’s very quick, he doesn’t analyze what he means, so it’s not terribly important, but the very text is therefore by Leibniz: “the individual envelops infinity.” What does that mean? It means something quite simple, but which, in my opinion, could only appear under a perspective in Christianity. What does it mean, the individual envelops infinity?
We can understand easily the individual-infinite relationship if we apply the notion of concept. How is a concept defined? Through this: there is an understanding and an extension. The understanding of the concept is the aggregate of predicates that are attributable to it – that’s what you call the understanding of a concept. The comprehension of a concept is what thing is designated by the concept, the aggregate of attributes that are predicable to it. For example, the lion is a courageous animal. I would say that “courageous animal” belongs to the comprehension of the concept “lion”. Let’s add other traits of the concept’s comprehension: “having a mane”, “roaring”, “sleeping a lot”, etc…. But you will object: you are forgetting the essential point. That’s on purpose: I am forgetting the traits by which we define the concept “lion”. Besides I don’t know them: mammal, I don’t know what, the essential characteristics, I don’t know them. So comprehension is the aggregate of predicates that one can attribute to the object of the concept. Ok? The extension of the concept is the number of copies , the number of objects subsumed under this concept, placed under this concept. How many lions are there? “How many lions are there?” responds to the extension of the concept. Fine.
The logic of the concept tells us what? It tells us that the more the extension diminishes, the more the comprehension increases, and vice versa. The more the extension diminishes, what does that mean? The more the extension diminishes, that is, tends toward one, the more the comprehension increases. Or the more the comprehension increases, that is, tends toward infinity, the more the extension diminishes, that is, tends toward one. These are things you have to know. An example, the concept “lion”. I suppose that currently there exist ten thousand lions. I give the extension as 10,000, the comprehension as this, that, such and such predicable attributes of “lion”. I make a step forward in a movement we can call the specification of the concept, another thing you have to know. I take the lions of the Sahara, belonging to the concept “lion”. The lions of the Sahara all have the traits attributable to “lion”. These are “lions”, but moreover they have more traits, specifically the particular traits of lions of the Sahara that other lions don’t have. That lions from… well, from elsewhere, don’t have: for example, having at the end of the tail a thicker clump of hair than for others. I would say, this is a trait of the comprehension of lions of the Sahara that other lions do not display, that I add on. I would say that lions of the Sahara have a greater comprehension than lions in general, but for that reason, they have a lesser extension. There are fewer lions from the Sahara than there are lions . Good. Let’s continue.
Biologists, or rather natural historians, naturalists can be led to say “Aaaah, but in such and such an oasis in the Sahara, there is a kind of lion that is not found in other regions of the Sahara.” That will make comprehension greater and extension lesser. Look at this quite simple great principle: given a concept, its extension and its comprehension are in inverse relation, that is: the greater the comprehension, the smaller the extension. You follow me because this is not going to be easy.
What happens? I hesitate, I am going to do what I never want to do, a kind of overview of philosophy, and here it’s absolutely necessary. What was happening regarding the concept, regarding this law, before Leibniz? I think that all philosophers – to my knowledge, without exception – in general, without exception, all philosophers told us: yes, but the concept ceases at a certain moment. There is a logical moment at which the concept ceases, that is, there is a logical moment at which the concept’s comprehension ceases. Below this, that’s no longer from the concept. You have to cease at some moment. Example, I come back to my lion : a lion from a particular oasis, African lion, Saharan lion, a lion from a particular oasis in the Sahara.... 
… says: in that, you won’t reconnect, you can go all the way to that indefinite – I am weighing my words – you can go to the indefinite, you will be able to prolong the concept’s comprehension indefinitely , you will never reach the individual. Why? Because the individual depends on accidents of matter and not on traits in the concept. There will always be several individual under the concept. Were this only strictly speaking , there will always be several possible individuals. Even if I reached a state of the world in which only a single lion survived, the concept does not go all the way to its individuality. In fact, by virtue of the concept, there will always be an infinity of possible lions. The concept does not go to infinity. You can continue to the indefinite, you can continue indefinitely to push the concept’s comprehension, you will never reach the extension = 1. Any concept qua concept is liable to have an extension = x.
But then, what constitutes the individual since it isn’t the concept? In other words, the concept is always general. It always has an extension. The Saharan lion has a concept, the lion of a particular oasis has a concept, as far as you want, but individuation is not the same thing as specification. You can specify your concept as long as you want, but you will never reach the individual. What constitutes individuation? Certain Aristotelians answer: it is not form, which is form of concept; it’s matter, it is accident. In other words, they find themselves faced with the following problem: the individual is not an ultimate form that might be relatable to the concept. The individual is not an ultimate form, in other words, the concept ceases before the individual. You can pursue it indefinitely, but you will not reach the individual. 
Hence this problem: what constitutes individuation since it is not a complicated specification? So I tell you: the first answer : accidents, contingencies have to be made to intervene, that is, attributes that do not belong to the concept. Another answer, much more complex: individuation indeed depends on the form, but is not itself a form. This is notably a very lovely theory of individuation from Duns Scotus, where individuation is defined. He tells us: this is not a form which is added to form as a kind is added to genera . In other words, there are no forms of the individual. However, individuation is not an accident of matter. He tells us, it’s the ultimate act of form. This isn’t simple: this isn’t a form that is added to form; it is the ultimate act of the final form. What does it mean, the ultimate act of the final form? Well, this isn’t the focus here, it would be another course. This is to tell you, simply, that everyone agrees about this: that in the long run, the form or the concept, in one way or another, stops before the individual, does not link up with the individual, even if I can push indefinitely the concept’s comprehension. Fine. 
Let’s have Leibniz speak. Never has anyone witnessed so much calm in the presence of so much daring. He will explain that there is no indefinite. There is only an actual infinite. He will immediately define the individual as the concept; the individual is the concept. The individual is the concept insofar as its comprehension is infinite and its extension unity. A concept whose comprehension is actually infinite, you see it’s the actual infinite that allows him to say that. If he said: the individual is the concept whose comprehension is indefinite, that would make no sense. It’s because there is actual infinite everywhere according to Leibniz that this definition is possible. It was therefore impossible for the neo-Platonists who had no idea of the actual infinite. 
My difficulty is not to be able to tell you yet what the actual infinite is. But no matter, it suffices that you have a kind of little affective feeling. He tells us: the individual is the concept; not only do I reconcile them, but they are identical because the individual is the concept in so far as it has an infinite actual comprehension, and therefore an extension equal to 1. You see, the individual envelops the infinite. What is it that lets him say that the individual envelops the infinite? Where does he get this idea? We saw this, there at least for once we have seen this. It’s the whole preceding theory, in which the monad, that is the individual substance, envelops the infinity of predicates that the states of the world constitute. So the concept goes all the way to the infinite, or the notion is individual, it’s the same thing. The monad is the huge individual unity of an infinite multiplicity. 
In other words, if I had a mathematical symbol to propose for the individual, I would say – you are perhaps going to understand everything thanks to this – 1 / infinite, one over the infinite. You may say, what interest is there in this? You are going to see why it’s of interest; it will be an amazing interest! And after we can’t go farther! Once you’ve understood the interest, we will go home to bed. 
All this is curious, this individuality, this notion of individuation that invades philosophy. Why do I say this presumes Christianity? Because Christianity, under its philosophical form, is well known for confronting a very interesting problem that has not lost its pertinence today, specifically, the proofs of God’s existence. And the proofs of God’s existence, it is well known – it won’t be greatly discussed although it interested Leibniz greatly – the most noble is called the ontological proof. And the ontological proof, it is well known that it is stated as follows: I define God as and by the infinitely perfect, the infinitely perfect. I conclude from this that God exists since if it didn’t exist, it would lack a perfection. You follow me. This is why we all think that God exists… Where we get into trouble is when someone like Leibniz, who nonetheless is quite in favor of the ontological proof, says: one mustn’t move so fast because what does “infinitely perfect” mean precisely? For the proof to be conclusive, says Leibniz, one must at least show that the infinitely perfect does not envelop contradiction.
Assume that the infinitely perfect might be a notion like a squared circle. In that case, I couldn’t conclude that the corresponding being exists. I could not; it would not be reasonable. The “greatest speed”, says Leibniz, is a contradictory notion; why? Because, by virtue of the definition of “speed,” with a given speed, there is always a greater possible speed. So, the greatest speed is nonsensical . What tells us that the infinitely perfect Being isn’t nonsensical? So he says: ontological proof can only conclude for the existence of God if it first shows that the absolutely perfect is a coherent notion, that implies no contradiction. Leibniz takes on the task of showing this. He is going to show it by showing that the infinitely perfect is l’omnitudo, the aggregate of all possibilities, and that the aggregate of all possibilities is possible. -- I seem to be wandering off, but you will see that this will sneak back on us at the moment we least expect it. -- The aggregate of all possibilities is possible, that’s what had to be shown for the ontological proof to be able to draw a conclusion out of the infinitely perfect to the existence of a corresponding God.
Great, and there we are! But if the aggregate of all possibilities is possible, in that case God necessarily exists, because the ontological argument works. Specifically: God is the infinitely perfect being, if it didn’t exist, it would be lacking a perfection; thus, I would contradict my definition in refusing him existence. So the ontological proof legitimately stands, according to Leibniz, on the condition of having shown that the aggregate of all possibilities was not nonsensical, provided that – parenthetically, he reproached Descartes for not having completed the necessary demonstration – he can draw a conclusion from the aggregate of all possibilities to the idea of a necessarily existing being, a singular Being, individual, singular, unique, called God. The ontological proof, according to Leibniz, thus goes from the infinite aggregate to the singular existence of a corresponding being, to the singular existence of a corresponding reality called God. 
In other words, what is God’s expression ? I am going from the infinite aggregate of all possibilities to the singular existence of the corresponding being, which is endowed with all perfections and that I call God. Hence the proper name God. Everything occurs between proper names. What is the mathematical formula for the ontological proof? The mathematical proof for the ontological proof is infinity over 1, Infinity / 1. Why? Let’s return to his reasoning.
Infinity equals the aggregate of all possibilities. From this I conclude, if the aggregate of all possibilities is possible, that a corresponding individual being exists. I go from the infinite to the individual. In the case of God, I would say: the infinite envelops individuality. That’s the ontological proof. If we were to come up with a suitable corresponding formula, the ontological proof, the proof of God’s existence is: the infinite envelops individuality, understood as the individuality of God, the singularity of God, Infinity over 1. For other reasons, you have just seen why the monad had as mathematical symbol 1 over infinity . In fact, this time I start from individual unity, and this individual unity encloses the infinity of predicates one over infinity, I would say, from God to the monad, to the individual subject . 
What is that about, what is the relation? Here it is. That allows me to say that the monad is the inverse of God. Inverse? Inverse? What is that? Inverse means something very precise, that you have to know about. It’s in this sense that philosophy implicates a kind of knowledge . One has to know the sense of words. Why, for example, don’t I say “the opposite”? Why don’t I say that the monad is the opposite of God, or the contrary? This is not without a reason. Logic presents us with a very strict table of opposites, and we know that opposition by the contrary is not the same thing as opposition by contradiction. We know that there are all kinds of opposition. Is inversion perhaps a type of opposition? But not just any old type. In this you simply cannot say… as much as you have the right to create concepts if you can, equally you have no right to omit the necessary science from philosophy, exactly as if you were doing mathematics, you would not have the right to ignore the science necessary for doing mathematics. So precisely here, since we are talking about mathematics, in math there is the notion of “inverse numbers”. Given a whole number, 2, what is its inverse? The inverse of 2? The contrary of 2 is -2. The inverse of 2 is a half. Why? Because there is no whole that you cannot write under the form numerator/denominator. So the number 2 is 2 over 1; the inverse of 2 over 1 is 1 over 2. The denominator becomes the numerator, and the numerator becomes the denominator. Thus 1 over 2 is the inverse of 2.
I am saying, strictly speaking: the monad 1 / infinity is the inverse of God infinity / 1. This is literally true. So everything happens at this level, everything happens between individuals. Once we have said that there is the infinite everywhere, but simply this is not the same infinite. You understand that when Leibniz tells us: everything is infinite, and all is infinite in action , there is no indefinite, there is only the infinite. That does not prevent there being all kinds of infinites. The infinity of God is not the same as the infinity of the world enveloped by each individual, not at all. But I can say that the individual is exactly the inverse of God, each time you have the infinite and individuality. It’s through the couple infinity-individual that Leibniz is going to shake up all of philosophy. He causes the concept to go all the way to the individual. He is quite precisely the first to reconcile the concept and the individual since the comprehension of the concept not only can be extended indefinitely, but all the way to infinity.
All that seems quite arbitrary. That’s what he decided, but understand to what that commits him, and this is the point I wanted to reach because…  When others said, and didn’t see the means of extending the concept to the individual, when they thought that the concept had to stop before the individual, even if one could indefinitely extend its comprehension, it’s because they had a really odd way of developing the problem of individuation. And in this I allow myself to speak on my own behalf, but in the hope of having you understand something in Leibniz. It seems to me that all the theories of individuation before Leibniz had a catastrophic presupposition. Their catastrophic presupposition was that individuation comes afterwards, after the specification. Specification is the division of the concept in genres, kind , smaller and smaller kinds. And it was quite simply assumed that it was entirely normal to begin by the most general, and that was Plato’s fault, the fault of others, but finally, nobody’s and everybody’s fault. They start off from the most universal, so necessarily, they don’t link back up with the individual. Since individuation is not a specification, it’s not by extending specification indefinitely that one will find the individual. So as they were telling themselves that the individual comes after the final kind , that the individual comes after the tiniest species, they are lost in advance, they will never be able to close the gap between the tiniest species and individuals. The contrary would have been required, only they didn’t have the means to do it. They had to become aware that all specification, that is, all assigning of kind or genre, I don’t say presupposed individual objects – that has already been done, it’s what is called the nominalism – no, it’s a matter of saying something else, but that all specification presupposes processes of individuation that, henceforth, cannot occur according to this type of specification. In other words, it’s individual that is first. 
If individuation is primary, in fact everything is comprehensible. The double individual-infinite relation, I say double relation: in the God’s case, infinity/unity, in the monad’s case, unity/infinity. In this sense, we take up this literally inverse relation of the monad and God. That allows us to pose all sorts of problems: if it is true that all individual substance is a point of view, is God a point of view? Can I talk of God as a simply infinite point of view? Is God something other than a point of view? Very strangely, the texts of Leibniz waver there. No doubt one could be both: God is indeed a point of view that passes through all the points of view, but at the same time, the Leibniz’s richest texts suggest that there are God views that engender points of view, but that there is no God point of view. Do you understand in which sense there is no God point of view? It’s that infinity / 1 is not a point of view formula. The point of view formula is 1 / infinity. That does not keep God from penetrating all points of view, precisely because the points of view are inverse from God’s position. The point of view position is inverse from God’s position. 
That’s all we’ve got. It remains for us finally to say that we’ve completed our first part . We have more or less shown how the upper floor developed. What we can simply conclude is that, in fact, it’s nonetheless an absolute reorganization of the tradition of two worlds. There are indeed two floors, but is this still two worlds? On the upper floor, there are individual substances that envelop the world. They envelop the world since they have for attributes all the states of the world. On the lower floor there is matter and its thousand pleats . What is there between the two? I have shown how the two floors communicated . I showed this since I showed that inflexion participated both on the upper floor, since it’s the ideal genetic element, and that it’s starting from inflexion that we reached point of view and inherence, it belongs to the upper floor, but refers as well to the lower floor since it is the genetic element of pleats of matter. So the two floors communicate. This is completely new, which means that, on the upper floor, there are only subjects as individual notions. And God, it’s true. There is an infinity of 1 / infinity, and a sole all encompasser , a single infinity / 1.
So what is this Baroque world? I told you the last time Tintoretto’s paintings. You have to occupy two floors. There are no longer two worlds. We have to think about that; there are no longer two worlds, there are two floors: a floor in which bodies fall, and a floor in which soul fly forth . That’s what the Baroque world is: A floor of pleats of matter that never cease to overflow, in which bodies lose their equilibrium, are caught up in masses, all that. And then, on the upper floor, there is the dance of souls, a thousand modes of communications between them. Take a typically Baroque quite famous painting, El Greco’s The Burial of Count Orgaz, this famous painting by El Greco. Both floors are represented: below the burial and the participants at the burial, and above, on the upper part of the canvas, the extraordinary spontaneity of subjective forms, subjective forms called celestial, but are not so. Take Tintoretto, on one floor it falls, on another there’s a kind of incredible dance. It’s not even the movement, it’s the liveliest spontaneity, but are these really similar? Why are these two painters considered as two geniuses of the Baroque? 
So we are putting aside the session that we could have held on this because we have to make up time, but what we can gather is that the two floors are not a way of again baptizing the two worlds. It’s an extremely forceful way of placing in question the two worlds. On the upper floor, you will only find individual notions, individual subjects; on the lower floor you will only find matter in its pleats. These are not two worlds. What relations will there be between them? Beginning to emerge is Leibniz’s final very great concept: the relation will always be named harmony. Harmony. Why harmony? When we get there, to talk about harmony in Leibniz, because it’s one of his great concepts, we mustn’t forget what we discussed today. My dream would be to find things as stupid as that; I realize with astonishment that, I think, they haven’t been completed, so yet another reason for us to complete them, that no one has tried to create the list of senses of the word “harmony”, once we admit that, in Leibniz, they all intervene. Notably if you recall back to grade school , perhaps you recall that there is a harmonic mean of numbers that is not the same thing as the arithmetic mean. The arithmetic mean isn’t difficult, but the harmonic mean? We have to relocate our childhood suffering, because this isn’t just nothing. We have to re-understand what a harmonic mean is. And I close on this today, and why? Because a harmonic mean deals with numbers and their inverses, and because the harmonic mean passes through the relation of the number and its inverse, like 2 and 1/2 . It’s the consideration of inverses that defines the harmonic mean in contrast to the arithmetic mean. We have to reflect on this.
So, in the second trimester, when we get back in the new year, I hope nonetheless that we will begin to consider the relationship between Whitehead and Leibniz … in its musical, arithmetic aspects, all of that. … Isabelle, Isabelle, please wait for me, wait for me so that we can talk, if you have a moment.
Leibniz as Baroque Philosopher : Fragment -- Preformation and Epigenesis, and the Monad, the Souls, and God
... The two words have an independent sense … in such conditions that another word would be required, and one was located. The other word is epigenesis since epigenesis is at least opposed to preformation. Epigenesis is the development of an organism through the appearance of new characteristics, that is, characteristics that were not contained previously in any form whatsoever. In the development of an organism, the principle of epigenesis is this: the development of an organism does not consist in developing previously extant parts, however small these might be, but in causing entirely new characteristics to emerge. This idea, in fact, does not come from Darwin; it's the achievement of a biologist named Wolff who is the creator of this notion of an epigenesis. Going forward, evolution is the creation of these new forms; we are developed through the creation of new forms not previously existing, so that everything that I would like to show in this parenthesis is that development and evolution in the seventeenth century have a meaning strictly opposed to the meaning they will take on after Wolff and Darwin, that is, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the end of the eighteenth and into the nineteenth century. That's how things often occurs for scientific notions, a complete reversal of the notion, so much so that you can constantly find the term evolution in the seventeenth century regarding the organism evolutionist because evolution always consists in the development of pre-formed parts, of infinitely small parts 

So I come back to Leibniz. You see, the organism contains an infinity of infinitely small organisms, that is, folded onto themselves in a thousand ways, all of this to infinity, such that Leibniz can say, but an organism never dies. It pleats its own parts to infinity; but an organism, necessarily, survives in its ashes. Why did he get mixed up in all that? You will say that it's not scientific at all. You see immediately his interest in preformation. It's because he judged that natural history could only become a science if it broke with the idea of spontaneous generation. So this is the idea that an organism can only be born from an organism. And in fact, it's the great argument of the Preformists: if there were no preformation of seeds at that point, nothing would prevent spontaneous generation. Good.
And so, here we have matter constituted through this infinity. Organic matter is constituted by this infinity of infinitely small organisms folded into themselves in every manner possible. And development comes when -- and there is no doubt a word to evoke it -- God's decrees in the world's creation... God set a moment in which each seed will be called to unfold its own parts and a moment in which it will return to the folded and enveloped state. Yes? It's a vision. And so, we see well that, for Leibniz, a soul is always connected to an organism. Moreover, a soul never loses its body. A soul is always connected to a body. What does death mean? … We’ve see this before, but clearly, we need to repeat this. At death, says, it's not at all the soul is separated from the body; in the end, the soul is inseparable from the body. So what happens at death? When I die, that means my organism has finished its time, that is, its time of development. All that is organic folds back to infinity, folds back to infinity. Although I might have myself cremated, the soul subsists in the ashes. So my soul hasn't left its body. It's simply that instead of being in a rapport with a developed body, it's in relation with a body infinitely pleated and enveloped onto itself. See what Leibniz had in mind that we hardly ever have in mind: it's about justifying resurrection, the resurrection of bodies. For the hour will come in which, for the second time, God will call us toward the development of our organic parts, and that will be the resurrection of bodies. Leibniz tells us that this is very poorly expressed, the resurrection of bodies, since it's nothing other than the way in which God calls back our implicated organism, our enveloped organism, to a second term of development. This is a beautiful idea, but the Catholics didn't like this, they greatly criticized Leibniz, you're rather materialist since you thought up this tale.
But that's not all. So I would say there are souls enveloped and developed, organic souls. There are souls that have been developed everywhere in this state downstairs. They are infinitely disseminated in the folds of matter. See, when I die, that means that my organic soul folds itself infinitely into the pleats of matter. I fold myself infinitely into the pleats of the ashes, and there I wait, I wait calmly for God, as Leibniz says, to recall me into the great theatre. The great theatre of what? the floor above, not that all souls are called to the upper floor. All the souls, simply animal and sensitive, stay on the lower floor, either infinitely folded into the pleats of matter, or unfolded according to their infinite dream of development. Good. This is the lower floor. These are the souls that Leibniz calls sensitive souls.
And certain souls have been predestined as reasonable by God from the start of creation, endowed with reason. An infinity of souls have been created by God as reasonable souls. What does that mean? Reasonable souls are special souls. They are inseparable from an organism, and one that is folded. They too haunt the lower floor; they too haunt the lower floor. You see, there are no other words than haunting the lower floor”. But when the moment arrives, foreseen by God's decrees, when that moment comes, then their parts are not satisfied with developing themselves up to a that corresponds to the perpetuation of the species, so they climb to the upper floor. The word that Leibniz uses that had a sense then that has to be taken literally, the souls predestined to be reasonable experience an elevation. We have to take this literally in our schema. They go from the lower floor where they existed insofar as they are folded on themselves, and they reach the upper floor toward the region of their destination. These are veritable souls that fully deserve the word monad, and only they deserve the word monad. The others are only designated as sub-monads, or inferior monads. And then, in the developed reasonable soul, for the reasonable soul and only it, to develop is to rise above, climb, to pass from one floor to the other. And so, for that reason, when you encounter the word elevation, we almost have to take it in a kind of unique sense, and at that moment, it's those monads, reasonable souls that, as such, include the folds that link to innate notions, to innate ideas, of pre-correspondence to the upper floor. They have climbed from the lower floor to the upper floor, and to the farthest limit, it is they that constitute the upper floor. In fact, the upper floor is since the upper floor is uniquely of monads without doors or windows, that is, of reasonable monads. 
And I’d like for you to sense how through this kind of natural slippage, there are also perpetually references of what we’ve seen concerning the mathematical side and all that. Since I am reviewing, what has my subject been? In the end, it has been to emphasize the inflection-inclusion relation, how to go... I believe that we aren't speaking about Leibniz if we don't talk about inflection. That's all I wanted to say, and it's where we will pick up the next time. We have to start off from inflection and from the basic mathematical givens, from there, downstairs, to inclusion, that is, to the discovery of the monad. That was the first important point, and it presupposes and refers to a conception, I don't know how to say it, a mathematico-logical conception of infinity. If you haven't understood the necessity of the passage from inflection to inclusion, I believe that this cannot become clearer for what Leibniz says. And the second point, this time, if we don't directly take account of the infinite, this kind of face-off or expression of reversed figures of God and the monad, that is, of God and the individual notion, of God and the individual. I was telling you the expression...

Deleuze: I cannot reference that here. It's outside this drawing. There is much more in the inflection-inclusion relationship than this drawing allows to be expressed. There is no reason for having a drawing that would include totally everything... For me, some drawings are ok; the other kind, well, in one sense it's not what's obvious because it's a matter of having a little intuition, you know...
If I say, what is this? Because the question is ... Henceforth if add, here I have the monad, I have the monad in referring to it in bulk, but in all that, I haven't yet seen God, and yet it is everywhere because we talk about it all the time; we constantly have to refer to God. Where will we situate it? So I’m not saying it’s encompassed in the drawing provided that this would be for other constructions. We can immediately sense, for example, that this, on the upper floor, one finds a single monad, with neither doors nor windows, with its internal tapestry, and containing and including the world; it sustains an infinity of monads. You recall what includes the world, each with its own point of view. So, I believe that from one monad to the next, the folds are not the same, they are not in the same order. So in fact, the little construction upstairs is doubled infinitely. 
Pinhas: Entirely, because even theoretically, there is…
Deleuze: It’s a device…
Pinhas: Boulez uses that in “Répons”.
Deleuze: Ah, the famous device, it’s a harmonizer. Ah, pre-established? 
Pinhas: No, the accords are pre-selected. 
Deleuze: I understand that, but pre-established, it’s as if we can take ourselves for God. I need a diagram; you have to find a diagram for that. You will show me the diagrams. Do you have them? You haven’t lost them ?
Here’s our task: the first person up will be discussing singularities, and I will give you a call. Next week I will know a bit more in what… So, we will see. I mean, if we have time, if there aren’t too many “events”… Yes? 
Deleuze: No, so you have not understood me because… What emerged from what I said was that there couldn’t be any reincarnation since we never lose our organism. has an admirable, adorable text where he says: the whole Orient was wrong because there is no metempsychosis; there is a meta-schematics. And meta-schematics means the stages of envelopment and development. There cannot be any metempsychosis because there cannot be a soul without a body, and there cannot be a soul passing from one body to another. You are condemned to your body; simply your body might be big and voluminous and give you all kinds of satisfactions, or your body might be so folded into itself that it lies in ashes, in the folds of matter. So then, you are completely deadened since you yourself are without any reason. Following this splendid idea, in this state of the organism completely folded in on itself, the organism grasps things, continues to perceive, but everything is a rumbling ; it’s the state of rumbling. When your organic parts are completely folded, you are exactly in the same state as the single thing that could give you a vague idea of your developed state; it’s when you received a whack on the head, and you fall unconscious. There is no death; there are unconscious states in this person, which is marvelous. I faint, you see, I am going to faint, and this is how I am, as if I had been whacked on the head. Since, if you wait a while, it’s the vampire’s death. I get smaller, I get smaller, and then you no longer can see me, but I am still attached to my body that is folded into itself. So there are never any reincarnations because there is no basis for reincarnations. There is no metempsychosis. I cannot move myself from one body to another, not at all. You will never be haunted by someone else’s soul. Each one of us keeps his or her body, simply such a state in which it will be rediscovered for a glorious moment of the bodies’ return.
But you see, the bodies’ return is not the same thing as the elevation. Elevation is a lay concept. It’s when the souls called upon to be reasonable unfold their own parts and are henceforth called to the upper floor, on condition that they come back down when they refold their parts after having completed their lives. It’s beautiful. Between the two currents? Metempsychosis and this kind of doctrine? Listen, it’s not that… Listen, I would say that it’s not a question for the history of philosophy because if you desire this kind of debate, it’s one that, I believe, the Christians led in their opposition to transmigration, to metempsychosis. And on the other hand, it was already fashionable in the seventeenth century, greatly so, the discussion between a Christian philosopher and a Chinese philosopher. There’s a treatise by Malebranche that isn’t bad, precisely called Dialogue between a Christian Philosopher and a Chinese Philosopher. If he had an idea: that the Chinese were stronger than the Europeans, but that the Europeans were nonetheless weaker than Leibniz. So, the idea is that… I was telling you earlier that to undertake decompositions – but do I have time to discuss all this? I was thinking that I’d let you speak, and then… But here we are, these are good things since this will make Leibniz more familiar to you.
He said, in order to undertake decomposition, one must not think that everything is possible; moreover, one must find a good symbolic system. Very often, you cannot decompose something because you do not find the symbolic system. And taking… Let’s come back to the problem of numbers. Leibniz tells us something very, very unusual for the seventeenth century and that only the mathematicians of his era understood completely. But he so fears exchanges of ideas of mathematical philosophy in the seventeenth century, it’s quite funny what he says. He says, you understand, if you remain in the decimal system, the current system, there will be some very difficult things to demonstrate about numbers. For example, to demonstrate that 3 times 3 equal 9 is not easy. He adored this kind of demonstration; in the next class, we will see how he shows that 2 times 2 equals 4, some thoughts in his attempt at logics and Combinatories and characteristics. And Serres was right, that this is the way in which he was so modern. But if you take the decimal system, it’s not easy. On the other hand, in some ways, he says, the binary system, which recognizes only two terms, only two digits, 0 and 1 – it’s the binary system in which you write all numbers with 0 and 1, you see? I am reminding you for those who don’t recall it… You learned in school, I hope. 0 is 0; 1, you write 01, that is, you write 1, that still works. 2 in the binary system is 10. There, you remember everything. 4 100; 5, you write… There you are, etc. etc. You have the binary system. If you multiply 3 times 3, you have 11 by 11. There, you remember everything. These are things that we studied in junior high school, it seems to me. 
Leibniz says, to complete the demonstration that 3 times 3 equals 9, it’s much easier, and the operations are much shorter, if we do it through the binary system than using the decimal system. Fine, he showed this. It interested him greatly because he says, in the end, what’s brilliant in the binary system is that the two signs are the signs of being and nothingness. He has a very beautiful text, this is how God calculated. God obviously calculated in the binary system since there are only two things, being and nothingness. It cannot calculate by 10, God. That would be absurd. And, he says, the Chinese – in this, it’s a philological text. Leibniz’s texts are essentially divided between philosophy, mathematics, and then a whole group of texts: there are philological texts, some texts on mines. He was interested in everything – mines! Do you know why he was interested in mines? Well, I understand him. At least, I can explain it, that’s an advantage. It’s because of veins and lodes; mines are inflections. That was his passion, the story of lodes. That proved he was right about all his tales of pleats of matter. Mines are the very case of the state of matter in pleats, such that in all kinds of letters, Leibniz asks specialists all manner of details on mines, how to create a silver lode, all that. Mines are , he is going to do research down there, and what interested him is how matter pleats itself. If you are a bit familiar with Descartes, you have to feel to what extent a philosophy is foreign, even if it deals with apparently similar problems. Leibniz’s curiosity is always evident, but it twists things; there’s never anything straight. Things never cease being twisted. How does one recognize a world in which everything is twisted? Must we untwist it? Descartes untwists everything. Descartes could care less about coordinates such that… Ok… Descartes thinks of only one thing : straightening. Not Leibniz; one must follow inflections; one must see where they lead me. One must… So, mines are admirable, with inflection and inclusion. You think of all that this contains to please him: inflections and the monad. He’s happy; he’s more than happy, he is delighted. It’s the very world for Leibniz that he finds in mines.
But then, the Chinese! The Chinese, he says, possess a form of calculus that no one understood given its deep mystery. I don’t recall the name of this calculus anyway. provided it. I don’t know; perhaps we need to ask a specialist in Chinese. Oh! We have one here! Ah, but of course! Ah, I no longer recalled that, but, yes, yes, yes! What little I recall of Leibniz’s text, we will need to ask for an explanation… it’s… He operates through two sorts of signs, those that are very full and those that are pointed. It’s a calculus… and we are told that missionaries have still not been able to penetrate the secret of this calculus. Fine, there is still a hope… Ah, really? So, it’s binary… It’s Leibniz… Perhaps with the help of the missionaries, he says, but it’s a binary calculus. And then he says, mine, ours, the binary calculus in Leibniz’s life is better because the symbols of the numbers 0 and 1, for Leibniz, are infinitely more manageable than the full and disconnected lines. Ah, I am not getting into the question of who is right or wrong, but nonetheless Leibniz doesn’t forget the problems of the Christians, although he isn’t Catholic, but reformed. He says that we have to let our missionaries know urgently, he writes, because this could perhaps be useful for their converting the Chinese. So, they would travel there and tell the Chinese: you understand, you’re right. You have found the Christic truth. Only you don’t know that it’s Christic; you don’t know that it’s Christic because you are working with your two lines. You have in some ways remained Cartesians. The Chinese are too Cartesian. You kept using your lines, full lines and disconnected lines. But it’s not useful; if you manage to use arithmetic symbols that are truly symbols of God, 0 and 1, being and nothingness, at once you would recognize Christ’s superiority over your gods. You would convert, and we would go toward the world unity that Leibniz reveals. This story is very important… That creates another floor; in fact, one would have to and the Chinese… Fine, fine, everything is good.
So, your turn, ok. Your turn. You are entirely correct, except that, here we are, how will Leibniz get out of this? I suppose… Your comment is very, very precise. You are a good reader. We have to assume that this canvas or membrum being tensed had a way or force of action, that is, the tension refers to its physics of the spring , that is, of elasticity. So if we understand the text, I would understand it in the following way: this doesn’t mean that this canvas or membrum being naturally tensed, it means that this canvas or membrum when it is tensed represents the state of a spring, that is, a distended spring. So when is it tensed? It is tensed when the solicitations through tiny openings give it a shock, I assume. If not, the text here then presents a small problem. You are completely right. But it’s a kind of tension that if you release it, the fold reforms itself all alone, as the spring returns to its position, you understand? Hence the idea of active force. It’s because it isn’t tensed that if something coming from outside attached itself to the , then that tensed the fold. But notice at the same time, I am saying that there’s perhaps no point. It was… We can say what we want here, but perhaps there’s no point because you are telling me the stretched canvas, it makes no folds. But yes it does! That can be a stretched fold! That can be a rectilinear fold. Yes, it’s what enters from below. …] Agreed, hence there must be the solicitations from there. Yes, because, in fact, there is a fold that falls as rectilinear, that will be a stretched fold. There is the inflection fold and there is the rectilinear fold. For example, in a Gothic sculpture, the fold is rectilinear.
In Heidegger, I have the feeling that the fold is… Oh, this is too much, no. I have to review my notes. I think that it’s quite true what I am trying to tell you about Leibniz, but I have a thought in mind, that the conception of this odd word in Heidegger that returns constantly, the fold, is showing that, after all, it’s perhaps not such a bizarre notion as it appears, that it’s a notion with a very, very long philosophical history, and that the Heideggerian fold, I would almost say, is a Gothic fold, it’s a stretched fold, and that there are very few varieties. It’s when he still didn’t know how to manage the folds; he couldn’t create some inflection.
 Sartre, no, he cannot, he cannot, for a good reason, because Sartre… any reinterpretation of Sartre, who never considered commenting on Heidegger, for Sartre, the idea of the fold displeases him greatly. This is very intriguing in the anecdotic relations, because was Merleau-Ponty’s passion. But if, during the lives of Merleau-Ponty and Sartre, before Merleau-Ponty’s death, you consider their conversation and the point of rupture regarding the phenomenology of perception, it’s quite clear. Sartre spent his time saying: subjectivity is what creates holes. The fundamental topic for Sartre is holes, it’s holes. There is a full being, and there you find what he calls little traps of nothingness. So my question is not about knowing which is good or not, you understand; there are people who criticize Sartre saying, oh he understood nothing about Heidegger. This is idiotic because it would be valid only if Sartre had proposed understanding Heidegger. I would say that Sartre proposed to consider certain points in a methodology close to Heidegger’s. In this matter, he was convinced, and then he was trying to have something to say, and it’s not that he was right or wrong to have something to say, but well, he said it. And what he had to say moved through this dynamic of the hole. The world is like a full being, and in the world are formed, no matter how, kinds of holes, traps of non-being, that is called the pour-soi, that is, subjects. But it’s still the hole that Sartre invokes, and when he speaks of the other , he has this insolent metaphor for the other, specifically, the shithole . The Other looks at the world and – the metaphor is lovely – an other emerges. I am there calmly watching, and then I realize that someone is looking at something other than me. Here is where my world topples, and this world that was so well organized as a function of me begins to slip away right under my nose towards the appeal of the other, and it’s absolutely as if this fluid world tipped over to the other’s side in order to disappear there into a shithole. Well, that reconciled Sartre’s miserable tendencies , he always possessed that, the force of a violent metaphor, everything went there. But there are still holes and the entire theory of nothingness .
On this point, Heidegger and the Heideggerians get on their high horse. They say Sartre understood nothing about Heidegger’s thought. Ok, but once again, that’s not a fair question. What does it mean, for example, if Descartes climbed out of his grave and said, Kant understood nothing about my thought. Obviously, Kant understood nothing of Descartes’s thought; he had a greater task than understanding Descartes’s thought. Fine, one does what one can. So, on the other hand, from the start Merleau-Ponty is obsessed by… He wants nothing to do with holes. It’s very strange. I mean, these are concrete things, and for that reason, there’s nothing to discuss. I cannot persuade Merleau-Ponty that holes are necessary if he doesn’t like holes. No, this isn’t the question. The questions is what people create, it’s their work. It’s not about discussing, discussing. One has to tell Merleau-Ponty, fine, you don’t like holes, so do something else, something else. One has to conceive of things as axiomatics. So Sartre tosses holes into his axiomatic, holes as irreducible notions. Fine, very good. But simply put, what is he going to draw from this? If you draw nothing from it, then you have only kept holes for yourself. If it’s good, fine, you have created a lovely axiomatic.
And it’s not at all that I am indifferent to the true. I believe that truth is always there given the richness of Merleau-Ponty if we say something good. And there you are, there’s nothing to discuss. If Merleau-Ponty doesn’t want any holes, let him do something else. He creates folds, and from the start, from the end of The Phenomenology of Spirit, he says – he doesn’t seem to have a moderate position in relation to Sartre – he says, ah, I wouldn’t go so far as to say that the pour-soi creates nothingness , the pour-soi punishes being. It doesn’t create holes; it creates folds. It folds being. In other words, Merleau-Ponty created a faithful portrait of Heidegger, this is obvious, and from Heidegger he retains the idea of the fold, and he thinks that Sartre follows the wrong path because he understood nothing about the importance of the fold. And once again, it’s not that I am trying to understand the importance of this or that since he has something else in mind. And for Merleau-Ponty, you then find an entire conception of the fold that he is going to develop finally in a manner rather distant from Heidegger’s. He will take his distance from him as well. That doesn’t prevent him from being infinitely closer to Heidegger than Sartre ever was, and because of this idea of the fold, that he is going to develop in a very strange way – in the idea of a chiasmus, an optical chiasmus, you know, of a crossing of folds, there’s a kind of crossing, all that.
But what I would like to bring forth this year is this miniscule point, that perhaps the whole problem that is linked too much to the Heideggerian ontology, is very, very old, and that as in sculpture, we have always had folds. I mean, one doesn’t create sculpture without creating folds. Whether these are folds of flesh or folds of clothing, one could say that sculpture is the art of the fold, in a certain way, why not? But it’s obvious, not to be confused, it’s enough to look at the fronts of churches. You will not mistake a Romanesque fold from a Gothic fold. And moreover, you will not mistake a Roman fold for a Greek fold. My hypothesis is all the more strengthened, that truly the fold treated for itself, the autonomy of the fold, and this is Baroque. That’s what the Baroque is. The Baroque operation is the fold going to infinity. Thus it is no longer the rectilinear Gothic fold; one would have to define the Romanesque fold, and that would be very difficult, which we could if we had a specialist in sculpture. And you know, everything is yet to be done, right? We realize that things are quite wonderful because we cannot say at the same time that people are not working. They work enormously. But everything is left to be done. It would seem obvious that in sculpture, there are things created on the fold in stone. That seems to be a good topic.
So I am looking for the words in order to call up some specialists, and each time, it is painful. It’s quite rare specialists who know how to answer a simple question. I ask if there is… I am sure that there are great art critics who are working on the fold in sculpture. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Look, what strikes me, the way that someone… What does it mean to be systematic, that is, to be a philosopher? That doesn’t at all mean bringing everything back to a single, set idea; it doesn’t mean that at all. First, this implies having so many ideas, lots of ideas, and it’s tiring having lots of ideas. But it’s true that it’s about discovering resemblances between absolutely disparate things; it’s only about finding disparate things so strangely within an aggregate.
So, imagine Leibniz. He is obsessed by something, for example – and here I can end on this in order… It’s almost a conclusion for this interminable first part – the veins of marble. These veins of marble pleased him greatly. If you find in a text by Descartes or Malebranche an allusion to veins of marble, on one hand, that would astound me, and on the other hand, I bet this will be anecdotal and exterior. When it’s Leibniz, you understand immediately that for him it’s the formulation of a thousand essential ideas, that veins of marble will become a sign of four or five ideas that arouse him. Marble has veins, so what does this mean? Well, it means that there are inflections in marble, first of all. And second, it means that inflections are included in marble, and this provides him with an entire basis for great interest. Third, it means that there are pleats in marble. Veins in marble designate the pleats of matter.  And fourth, when Leibniz speaks to us about innate ideas, that is, ideas that reasonable souls discover in them and that do not come from the outside, like 2 and 2 make 4, he tells us what? He says that innate ideas are in power of action in souls as figures are in power of action in the marble worked on by the sculptor. That is, veins of marble are no longer pleats of matter, but are virtual figures that are in the soul, that is, these are folds in the soul. That is, my two kinds of fold can refer to the image of veins in marble. So this is something rather obsessive. I was telling you about mines, yes, but veins of marble are even better: they cover both floors, the upper floor and the lower floor. Veins of marble prefigure the figures that can be drawn out of the marble block. This is one case. A second case: on the level of matter, they prefigure the pleats of matter. The world is fundamentally marbled. To say that the world is fundamentally marbled means that marble is not simply something in the world. It is the figure of the world. In other words, it is already this movement of inflection and of inclusion.
